================================================================================

[Intro] I'm not perfect, but you can learn from me [Verse 1] Uh, uh (Uh) Hov on some other shit again You know what it is when we get to this part? Yeah We gon’ talk about money and how they hate us for it And all these rappers frontin’, tryna hide their lack of it They say "Hova don't rap no more", well, I might just do it 'Cause if I ain't rappin', then my niggas gotta eat offa somethin' So let me tell y'all where your favorite artist live at If he ain't sellin' drugs or stealin' cars, then he livin' with his momma Or stayin' outta trouble like them boys down in Atlanta But most likely, he got rich by makin' records That made him famous so now everybody wanna be friends With him, tryna borrow cash, ask him questions About who he fuckin', why he mad, and everythang else He used to hang around here, now he only come back To perform concerts and sign autographs For free food and drinks while he watchin' ball games
