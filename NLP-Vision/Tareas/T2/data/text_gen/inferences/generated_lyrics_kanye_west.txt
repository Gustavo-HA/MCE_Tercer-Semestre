[Intro]
I know He won’t forsake me
He won’t leave me
No matter what I do
And even if I go through hell tonight
He will still be God when it’s all over with
(God is) (God is)

[Verse 1]
They say build your own
I said fuck that, we gon' buy our way out
We ain't finna wait 'til they give us something to celebrate
So let's get this bread
Fuck up school and just drop out
But you can't drop out without dropping some knowledge first
Let me teach y'all how to make yourself rich
How to stay fly while staying righteous
First thing you need is faith as big as Mount Rushmore
Then take it from here

[Chorus]
Jesus saved my soul
Now I drive Rollies and Bentleys
Bought myself a couple chains
Spendin' money like I don't owe Him nothin'
Everybody want heaven but nobody wanna die
Nobody wanna cry no more
That means everybody wanna live forever
Not ready to meet Your maker
Ready to drink Per
