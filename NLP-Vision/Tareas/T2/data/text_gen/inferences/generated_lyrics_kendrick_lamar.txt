================================================================================

[Intro]
I don’t know what they want from me! I just wanna make them dance and have fun (Yeah)
They always try to say something negative about everything that I do
But it doesn’t matter 'cause my fans love me so much more than you ever could
And no one can take away how much we really connect on such an emotional level
So let ‘em talk, baby; I ain’t worried at all
Let ‘em hate, baby; I still got y’all
(Uh!)

[Verse 1]
The real is back, homie—get your umbrella up
Knowing these niggas like rainy days when they see my swagger up
Nobody better, but if there was somebody better
Then I would probably be him for a minute or two then
See, I been doing this since Pac had his first SUV
Before he even knew that life come with some bad publicity
Nowadays everybody gotta get theirs before they leave here
Everybody wanna play gangster, nobody wanna play Sega
Or Nintendo, man, those were good times though
When you didn’t need no guns to kill someone
