[Intro]
I donâ€™t know what they want from me! I gave them my life
They wanna see some type of drama? Here it is
(Bitch)

[Verse 1]
What up homie? What you writing about today? (Today?)
Writing 'bout these niggas that be hating on me (Huh?)
And all this fake love that surrounds me (Uh)
All this bullshit that goes around me (Yeah)
It gets tiring sometimes when you trying to stay positive
But negative energy always surrounding you
So how can we live with no stress and anxiety?
When everybody got something bad to say bout you
Everybody wants something but ain't willing to give nothin' back
Nobody really cares if you win or lose at shit
If your name isn't mentioned then nobody gon' mention you
Even though you did more than most people ever done
That'll make you feel like you worthless
Like you never won
Never been number one
Always second place even when you first
How do you deal with that kind of pressure? How do you cope?
Knowin' every move you make will affect your whole family tree
Your friends, your enemies, your lovers, haters, neighbors
The world, society, everyone expect perfection
From an imperfect person
Sometimes I wish I could just disappear for a minute
Just so y'all can appreciate me when I reappear again
Notice everything I do, notice everything I write
Notice everything I sing, notice everything I rhyme
Notice everything I wear, notice everything I drive
Notice everything I buy, notice everything I fry
Cook, eat, sleep, breathe, piss, shit, fuck, cum, die
Live, laugh, cry, try, survive, thrive
Do anything necessary to get by
Anything necessary to keep my head high
Keep moving forward regardless of who hate me
Regardless of who wait for me
To fall down off this pedestal where I stand
Wherever I land, whatever I am
Whatever I become, however far removed
However close to home, wherever I roam
No matter how much time pass, no matter how many times ask
One thing remain constant, I promise you this
My music will last forever
