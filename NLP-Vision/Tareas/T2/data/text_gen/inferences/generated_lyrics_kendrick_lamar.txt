[Intro] I donâ€™t know what to do with my life (Uh) [Verse 1] My mama said she prayed for me every day She knew that one day I would be okay But nowadays it seems like all her prayers went away And if God got problems then he better solve 'em today Cause I ain't tryna hear no more excuses No more lies and alibis Just gimme some truths so I can live righteous You see, I been on my own since nineteen Now twenty years later, still tryin' to find myself A nigga just wanna feel himself So many times I thought about endin' myself But you already know how much them thoughts is worth It'll keep you up at night when your mind start workin' Then make you question everything around you Even yourself Sometimes I think about movin', but where? Where could I go without being followed by my past mistakes? Everywhere I look there's always someone remindin' me who I was before I made this change The way they talk down to me like I didn't grow from nothin' Like I wasn't strong enough to stand on my own two feet They say I should thank them
