And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin'?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay." Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you? And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, "Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap" No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap" [Saxophone Solo] I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer [Hiphop: "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"] I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that "Truth" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty . And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't Be Life." And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude." [JAY-Z: "Oh you a real soulful dude, man"] And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take . And he said [JAY-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"] "Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?" [JAY-Z: "So what you think of this?"] And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to... [Donda West: "Come on, let's just go"] ...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up... [Donda West: "Kanye, baby, we're here"] ...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time , so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat to DMX [Hiphop: "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"] And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye." [Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"] "You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats" [Dame: "Jay got classics, G."] You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching , I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, "Man that was tight." [JAY-Z: "That, that was cool. That was hot."] That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint , "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's , and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post- Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them "Jesus Walks" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, "Naw." Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man... [Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."] I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up ["Y'all niggas is stupid"] Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad [Joe: "We gonna change the game, buddy."] Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay, man, just make sure it's not wack." [Dame: "You gotta make sure it's not wack."] Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.' "I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow I got 11 plaques on my walls right now You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow." Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like "oh shit" [Dame: "Oh shit it's not even wack."] "I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot." [Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."] Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know . So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick" [Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"] "You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer-rapper," and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal" [Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."] And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?" So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

What, nine weeks and you're home?" He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home" I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone Them crackers up there bleachin' your dome You're reachin' – I said, "The world don't stop, I got to keep, keep on" From there, I sensed the beef was on I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced And they show the other side, when they catch a new case It's on [Chorus: Too $hort & Jay-Z ] It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke And you bought a new home, where you could keep the folks I don't see how this side of you could be provoked Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what seven days can change A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names It was all good just a week ago [Verse 2: Jay-Z] Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell We both came in this game, blind as hell I did a little better, had more clientele Told you "put away some cheddar," now you cryin' for bail Seventeen, and I'm holdin' on to around a mill' I could bail out, blow trial, and come around on appeal Had niggas thinkin' I was from Uptown for real I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30 Freezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack Lookin' up and down the block, "the fuck is the dough at?"

Moment of Clarity Lyrics This song, with beat by Eminem, shows Jay looking back on his life and career, and the roads taken – and not taken – therein [Produced by Eminem and Luis Resto] [Intro] Woo! Gyeah, gyeah (Young!), gyeah Uhh, turn the music up, turn the lights down, I'm in my zone [Chorus] Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity This moment of honesty The world'll feel my truths All through my Hard Knock Lifetime , a Gift and a Curse I gave you Volume after Volume of my work So you can feel my truths I built The Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt Y'all can't fill my shoes From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about Nigga, feel my truths [Verse 1] Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales With that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work So a smirk was all on my face Like, "Damn, that man's face is just like my face" So Pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught Into the same game I fought (Ugh), that Uncle Ray lost (Ugh) My big brothers and so many others I saw I'm just glad we got to see each other Talk and re-meet each other Save a place in Heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!

Go with what makes sense Since I know what I'm up against We as rappers must decide what's most important And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win-win So next time you see the homie and his rims spin Just know my mind is working just like them (Rims, that is) [Chorus] Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity This moment of honesty The world'll feel my truths All through my Hard Knock Lifetime , a Gift And A Curse I gave you Volume after Volume of my work So you can feel my truths I built The Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt Y'all can't fill my shoes From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about Nigga, feel my truths [Verse 3] My homie Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall 'Cause he was on the block where no squares get off See, in my inner circle, all we do is ball 'Til we all got triangles on our wall Ain't just rapping for the Platinum – y'all record, I recall 'Cause I really been there before (Woo) Four scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow Prepared for war, I should fear no man You don't hear me though, these words ain't just paired to go In one ear, out the other ear – no! (No) Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars'll scab What, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back (Sup Big?) And the whole BK, nigga, holla back! (C'mon) [Chorus] Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity This moment of honesty The world'll feel my truths All through my Hard Knock Lifetime , a Gift And A Curse I gave you Volume after Volume of my work So you can feel my truths I built The Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt Y'all can't fill my shoes From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about Nigga, feel my truths

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Eckhart Tolle ] Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out Heart plays in ways the mind can't— Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out This is how we conceptualize human beings [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] My auntie is a man now I think I'm old enough to understand now Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards Motorola pager, off-white Guess jacket Blue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits '93 Nissan wax job, the earliest Big social, big personality, vocal Played the underground verbatim and stayed local My auntie is a man now I watch him and his girl hold their hands down Tip of the avenues under street lights made his Thinking, "I want me a bad bitch when I get big" They hug on the corner like California King Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado Scratching the likes from lotto Hoping that she pull up tomorrow So I can hang out in the front seat Six-by-nines keeping the music up under me My auntie is a man now Asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much She said, "Ain't no tellin' Niggas always been jealous because he had more women More money and more attention made more envy Calling him anything but broke was less offending" [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] My auntie is a man now I think I'm old enough to understand now Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards Back when it was comedic relief to say, "Faggot" "Faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain't know no better Elementary kids with no filter, however My auntie became a man and I took pride in it She wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference That's what I told my friends in second grade She picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed We pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing My auntie is a man now, what a relationship I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit He gave me some cash then gave me some game Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained She even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade The first person I seen write a rap That's when my life had changed House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window Cameras on the microphone, all women and men know My auntie was a man now, we cool with it The history had trickled down and made us ign'ant My favorite cousin said he's returning the favor And following my auntie with the same behavior [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] Demetrius is Mary-Ann now He's more confident to live his plan now ( Talking to the world's gonna bring you down ) But the family in disbelief this time ( Talking to the world's gonna bring you down ) Convincing themselves, "He ain't living discreet, he's fine" ( Talking to the world's gonna bring you down ) They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it ( Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ) The Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus ( Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ) He built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking ( Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ) "Faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain't know no better Middle school kids with no filter, however I had to be very mindful of my good cousin I knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him Demetrius is Mary-Ann now I mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further Changed his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain Living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon We didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant Wasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor Made raw, but time changes all [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar] Demetrius is Mary-Ann now Remember church, Easter Sunday? I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith More spiritual when these dudes were living life straight Which I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same He said my cousin was going through some things He promised the world we living in was an act on abomination And Demetrius was to blame I knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman Wondering if God still call you a decent man Still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint Until he singled you out to prove his point, saying "Demetrius is Mary-Ann now Church, his auntie is a man now," it hurt You the most 'cause your belief was close to his words Forcing me to stand now I said, "Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor? The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater? I recognize the study she was taught since birth But that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved" The building was thinking out loud, bad angel That's when you looked at me and smiled, said, "Thank you" The day I chose humanity over religion The family got closer, it was all forgiven I said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better Mistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound If ever they was pronounced without any intentions The very second you challenged the shit I was kicking Reminded me about a show I did out the city That time I brung a fan on stage to rap But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me You said, "Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction To truly understand love, switch position 'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together But only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'"
