Everything we did, how we live ( What? )
All this smoke got a scent

Everything I spoke, what I meant ( Ah )
Never disguise my intent, lines outside the event

You look at me and see a God figure (Uh)
And when I start vibin', I know that He with me
And I'ma always catch a hard shiver (Uh)

And my car quicker, huh (Skrrt)
I met her in church, she pray for me

Remember when I was broke, wearin' cheap coats
Now it's diamonds and houses and C notes (Uh)

Who let the monster loose? (Who let the monster loose? Huh)
They call me a product of my environment (Uh)
I tell them, "Nah, I'm what God produced" (Baow)
Defense good, and them guards can shoot (Baow)
I put 'em on you, it get hard to move
Tattoo in my face is the mark of truth
Gotta watch what you say when they market you (Huh)
I already predicted this (I already predicted this, huh)
Y'all only witnessed it (Y'all only witnessed it)
Look, got a couple old friends that I'm not really clickin' with
I know they pray that we settle our differences
I pray that they lower all my **** sentences
I got some demons I'm not even dealin' with
They in they feelings, I'm not really feelin' it
And I know some members that gave back they membership
****, you switched up, huh, like how you not feelin' me?
Look, I act like I care, but I don't really care
Now I live in a new buildin' with amenities
I got a new ceilin' with a chimney

I don't get too friendly with the enemy
You gotta move different when you in the industry, woo, yeah
You gotta move different when you in the industry, huh

Man, I'm tired of ****, I need Gatorade
Boy, I got on my feet and I made a name
And I made it a necklace, huh
When you from the bottom and you workin' hard
Just to get to the top, then they gotta respect it
If you got a voice, then you gotta project it
If you got a wrong, then you gotta correct it
If you got a name, then you gotta protect it
If you give me shock, then you gotta electric (Woo)
Tryna live a new life, so I got a new plan that I gotta finesse with (Look, yeah)
'Cause they want me to lose, that ain't part of the rules
I been tryin' so hard not to move reckless

[Chorus: Kanye West]
We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid, kid
Everything we did for the crib did here
Flexin’ with the business trip
Going cray, take some G6 ( Ah )
Lit, lit, '76
He split lids, then ask for shade, tsk-tsk-tsk
Take this trip, trip, trip, this, this
This, this, this, this
You all still lit, lit, lit
I'm off the grid, grid, grid, grid
Off the grid, grid, grid, grid

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First, it go viral, then they get digital
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doin' no interview
Mask on my face, you can't see what I'm finna do
Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the lo' and then that's where I send it to
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em "sorry," they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family'll never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me

[Chorus: Kanye West]
We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid, kid, kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

[Outro: Kanye West]
Pray for what folks and them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off His list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib
Some say A-A-Adam could never be bla-a-ack
'Cause a black man'll never share his rib, rib, rib, rib, rib, rib

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Verse 1: Vory]
Hard to keep my focus on what matters
Mandem hit my line like, "Some **** just got hit up on your block"
You can rest assured it's not us
'Cause we been out the wavе catchin' waves
They say, "We ain't seen you on thе block"
'Cause I been out the way
Chasin' millions in my sleep, I found the better way
Somewhere on an island, let me kick it, this my getaway
I pour up a drink for all my **** who ain't see the day
Tryna finish this with who I started with
Way too many fallen soldiers, no, I can't forgot
Hope they got headphones up in Heaven
You can vibe out and just hear this ****
It's just certain **** you can't forget

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Kanye and Jay still brothers, they both billionaires
And we ain't see it, I lost my brother when we was millionaires
I wasn't scared to die, but him, that was my biggest fear
I got your son and your daughter like you still here
Know how it feel to lose a brother, we got a bond still
Twenty-six years, pops got out to see his son killed
And I don't give a **** if I hang with a Crip, I see blood still
I can be the cleanest millionaire, I'm from the mud still
Died with his chain on, I call it blood diamonds
It's to the point I drop my own lo' so they could find us
And it's been months and they still hidin’
Kanye did it for the city, he co-signed

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Smoke a opp pack ain't funny like that
It get ugly like that, can't get no money like that
Holy Father, please, let me step in
Can't talk to buddy like that, it get bloody like that
Whole lotta steppers and they steppin'
And they sunny like that, and they comin' right back
And when you on tour, I bet you check in
'Cause my guys back to work, it's a Monday like that
And when you text, change the beginnin' of every word
You will speak to me with only no cap
Me and your big homie go back
And homie don't rap, you don't know me like that

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Outro: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Intro: Just Blaze]
The other night when I was researching what was going to be discussed today I came across a passage wrote down, I think it really exemplifies what the young brother next to me was just talking about and I learned that all things must come to an end
It is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence, all things must conclude
Take the analogy of a tree that grows in Brooklyn among the steel and the concrete with all its glorious branches and leaves,
one day it too will pass on its legacy through the seeds it dropped to the ground and as the wind carries these seeds throughout wherever they might move a new life will begin for each one of them
as they stand as a monument to the one that came before
That came before
That came before
That came before
That came before...

[Intro]
Somebody been running a long time
Somebody—

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod—
Shake that body, party that bod—
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 1: Pusha T & Kanye West ]
I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer (Woo!),
write it in bold letters
They love a nigga spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay' as a wholesaler
I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him (Yuugh)
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' HAM in Ibiza done took a toll on us ( Woo! )
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I'm goin' four door

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah & Kanye West ]
Shake that body, party that bod—
( That's rare, nigga )
Shake that body, party that bod—
( Ric Flair, nigga )
Shake that body, party that body ( Yeah, nigga )
Come and have a good time with G-O-D
( Yeah )
Shake that body, party that bod— ( Woah )
Shake that body, party that bod— ( Woah )
Shake that body, party that body ( It's the new God flow, niggas )
Come and have a good time with G-O-D ( Yo )

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Step on they necks 'til they can't breathe
Claim they five stars, but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck 'em, 'Ye, fuck 'em, 'Ye
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier
(Woo) They shit is shoppin' at Targét
(Woo) My shit is luxury Balmain
I'm balling, Amar'e
A nick' sold in the park, then I want in
What's a king without a crown, nigga? (What?)
What's a circus without you clown niggas? (Ha)
What's a brick from an out-of-town nigga?
When you flood and you can drown niggas? (Yuugh)
It's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M-A-dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod—
Shake that body, party that bod—
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know
I'm living three dreams
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's, uh
'Cause we can't get along, no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw, man, you sold your soul
Nah, man, mad people was frontin'
Aw, man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 3-1-2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like, "There the God go, in his Murcielago"
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
Forty killings in a weekend, forty killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ayy," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah & Kanye West ]
Shake that body, party that bod— ( Yo )
Shake that body, party that bod— ( Stop )
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, nigga
Yeah, I had my— I had my Jesus piece since '94
I don't know what I— I don't know what y'all talkin' 'bout
And my eagle
Still got it all in the bag, B (Yeah)
All I did was play possum
(Yo, come on)

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the MAC-11
My big lion haven't ate since twelve and it's after seven
We feed the nigga like forty chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I— I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin' they wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic (Come on)
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Said and shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone?
I said, "Probably"
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I'm not bow-legged, but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof and saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees
You can have a good time with G-O-D

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah & Kanye West ]
Shake that body, party that bod—
( That's rare, nigga )
Shake that body, party that bod—
( Ric Flair, nigga )
Shake that body, party that body ( Yeah, nigga )
Come and have a good time with G-O-D
( Yeah )
Shake that body, party that bod— ( Woah )
Shake that body, party that bod— ( Woah )
Shake that body, party that body ( It's the new God flow, niggas )
Come and have a good time with G-O-D ( Yo )

[Outro: Kanye West]
G.O.O.D. Music, G.O.O.D. Music
G.O.O.D. Music, G.O.O.D. Music

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Geah-geah-geah, geah-geah-geah
Ugh, ugh, ugh-ugh-ugh
Bap!

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Jay-Z ]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught, ugh )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Bought )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags ( Bags )
'Cause we be poppin' tags ( Geah ) pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Woo )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
We arose, let's go

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
"So Fresh, So Clean" like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin' tags
Leavin' the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
"Aw, fuck, there he go again
Talkin' 'bout hoes and dough again"—yup!
Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusing about the dough I spend
But I was holdin' then, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that, man
Fall back, I bought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rearview
V12 engine, corners spinning
Twinkies shinin', pinky ring
Armadale, nigga, stinky-stink
Top down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck, ma
That's right, you in luck, ma
You see me cruisin' down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First-come, first-served basis
You know Hov' be goin' to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin' cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll with your boy, you'll be poppin' tags

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Jay-Z ]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught, ugh )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Bought )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags ( Bags )
'Cause we be poppin' tags ( Geah ) pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Woo, uh-huh )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags ( What else? )
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 2: Twista]
It's a party when I go up in the store
Shopping while I'm zooted off the dro
Rolling like a nigga that just came up on a mil'
And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the floor
Bag full of clothes,
I remember having rocks in the hall
On the corner with the Glock by the balls
Serving up a jab and workin' security 6 to 6
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Buy what's on the wall, go ahead and treat yourself
When you come up on some cheddar, better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go up to the lot
And lay the paper down to cop that Jag'
I got a closet full of ammunition and funds
Mink, Rocawear and some guns, Pelle and a fresh pair of Jordans
Dro packs and Bo Jax and Air Maxes; throwbacks and 1's
No max for none
(When I go up in the store, a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller, if you want it, come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car, you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be chopping up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizzay
Poppin' big tags with the flow and the dough, we gets busy

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown, Jay-Z , & Killer Mike ]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught, ugh )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Bought )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags ( Bags )
'Cause we be poppin' tags ( Geah ) pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Woo , uh-huh )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags ( What else? )
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
Let me tell you something 'bout me

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
My throwback game is whiffle-wicked
Saint Patty's Day, green pinstripe
Number 20, Mark Spitz'n'
Jersey, ooh-wee, with the matching New Era fitted
White boys say my style is bitchin'
Keeping coke in the kitchen
Keep a Glock that'll shock and bring the rest
Tucked underneath my Mitchell & Ness
I'm scramblin', handlin' with a .45 cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two-deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside, holla, Felli Fel
More G's on me than a late-eighties Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan
Old man with the gun in hand, I leave your blood squirtin'
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest
Of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordans and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy, speak easy
Slight with the fighting words
I'll put something hot through your motherfucking Iceberg
Got a project chica named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro, reefer
Small baby-black gat tucked in her Baby Phat
I rock some, roll chief sacks like Daddy Fat

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown, Jay-Z , & Big Boi ]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught, ugh )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Bought )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags ( Bags )
'Cause we be poppin' tags ( Geah ), pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Woo )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags ( I'm poppin' )
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Pop tags in reverse, you'll be needin' a nurse
Leave you laying on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your mama in all-black with a matchin' purse
I know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call 'cause your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox 'pecting a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD
That means "Movie Date," "Dinner Date," "Lunch Date," help me
Please, my cheese is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimp-ously serve the song
Act a damn donkey like the pilgrims
When they popped the tag on the Indians' home
Drop top rag-o with the wind going
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of F.A.O. Schwartz for the chil'ens
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kidding
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the Honeycombs?
Oh now, you acting mad
'Cause the money done slowed down, just a lil bit
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall, bull-pit, dead game is the pulpit
Leave a motherpumper with his "John Doe" toe-tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin'
A miracle happenin'
Jay-Z, Killer Mike, and Big Boi rappin' and rhymin' and snappin'
Pop that tag on some of this game
No politics, swallow and keep the change

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Jay-Z ]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught, ugh )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Bought )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags ( Bags )
'Cause we be poppin' tags ( Geah ), pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught ( Caught )
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought ( Woo )
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Intro: Jamie Foxx and Kanye West ]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me
(Uh)

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money)
Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

Get down, girl, go 'head, get down

Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm"
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez,
four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money)
Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh

[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' 'round lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his?

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money)
Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh

[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week, he moppin' floors, next week, it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down, girl, go 'head

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round, 'round there, right, right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lost and found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy found out
That you turned out how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild,
I need you now
Love you (Got to)
Love you (Love you)
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost and found out

[Bridge: VIC MENSA]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh on Caesar
You found me in your gaze
Well, I found me, oh, Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Interlude: Kanye West]
And I need you now
Lost and found out
Yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impreg-a-nate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
Ayy, I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said, "Baby, what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?"
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph, around hella thugs?"
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves
(What if Mary) "What if Mary
(Was in the club) Was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?"
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
(And she was) We surrounded by
(Surrounded by) The fuckin' wolves

[Chorus: Bilal]
I know I shouldn’t've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm... (Fallin')

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uhh, said where I would stop before I even started
When I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick, then I looked to the sky like:
"Sorry, God, I lied, but give me one more try"
(Try)
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is
Can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night, see how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?
But there's a price for overdoing it
Doing it this big'll put you on the map, stick-up kids is out to tax
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
Damn...

[Chorus: Bilal (Jay-Z)]
I know I shouldn’t've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable, (Now ya) fallin'

[Verse 2: Jay-Z, (Bilal)]
When you should've fell back
Now you (Fallin'), right into they lap
Fallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen
Damn, you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
'Godfather'
,
'Goodfellas'
,
'Scarface'
,
'Casino'
You seen what that last run did to De Niro in
'Heat'
Can't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards
Now your tumbling is humbling, you're falling, you're mumbling
Under your breath, like you knew this day was coming (Fallin')
Now let's pray that arm candy
That you left your ex for, stay down and come in handy
'Cause come January it gets cold
When the letters start to slow
,
and your commissary's low
And lawyers screams appeal, only thinking about a bill
And your chances are nil
Damn, gravity's ill...

[Chorus: Bilal (Jay-Z)]
I know I shouldn’t've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable, (But ya) fallin'

[Verse 3: Jay-Z, (Bilal)]
And you can't get up
All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up
Locked down, the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on 'em
And the women that you left for this heifer got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something in your stomach
You're sick about what your life is becoming (Fallin')
But your "used-to"s, "has-been"s, ragging bad about all the new dudes
Talking tough on the YouTube 'bout what you used to do
But that's old school to the new crew
They doing numbers like Sudoku
They're the new you, and it's damn near inevitable
They'll experience déja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive, run and you'll never escape
So just fall from grace
Damn...

[Chorus: Bilal]
I know I shouldn’t've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm...

[Outro: Bilal]
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'

Skill Still Appeal Lyrics

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ughh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Ha ha haha HA
This feels like, right in front of the freeway
And when I'm done this should be in front of a DJ
I watch whack rappers put their soul on Ebay
Then expect excellence knowing their effortless
I don't have a preference, I dislike all
Say you run the globe? Well more like a disco ball
I spread love as well
Little nigga, big dreams, can bear-hug a whale into a lobster's tail
Ugh
Evacuate premises, rap's sinister suspicious
The pastor stand back, the bible is open, the words have been spoken
The moon and the stars align with the bars
The broads are snapping their bras in broad day
Cops meeting their quota running for arcades
The three initial's on the pistols printed all K's
The end is almost near,
inferior of nothing
Superior is an option and my synopsis is that I'm Frank Sinatra
On the roster, top running
Running races with my own shadow
Look in the mirror then I start to battle
Now a pyru is a crip, nor a pyru's just a value that is sure to be heard
Like a fuckin sheep's cattle, niggas got some nerve
Talkin bout they move birds
Only thing I move now is a noun and a verb
I am now on the verge of telling the real story
Of a Compton native in the city "that kill for me"
Cus you fabricated the realness
The county building and the county children on food stamps
Glorifying street cred, talkin' about "whoop whamp"
But that's never the case
Just a good lawyer who can sever the case
Recording live from the city where the skinny niggas die and the semi bullets fly
Drinking Remy out bottle till the pain run dry
Like a desert
Once the Desert Eagle ride by, what you reppin?
What you reppin my nigga, you got a weapon?
Well I got a profession my nigga
It's called hip-hop since Pac was on gridlock
Me against the world every hour, every second my nigga
You want something, get something
I could start a career AND I can end one, I'm H1N1
UGH
Straight-A student who flow stupid
Real raps get permanent income, UGH

Niggas in Paris (Remix) Lyrics

[Intro: T.I. & Chazz Michael ]
We're going to skate to one song, one song only
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
Aye man I don't know what been happening
I guess y'all must have caught amnesia in my absence
I ain't been gone that long, have I?
Well, just for y'all reminder
How about
the crown meet the throne
right here
Let's get it

[Verse 1: T.I. & JAY-Z ]
Call me T.I. no CPR, I'm killing shit
Even in prison I'm still the shit
Better recognize King in the building bitch
Act like you know you serious,
I ( ball so hard )
My ankle hurt
, don't buy a car if I ain't the first
In the country with a 1, 2, 3 bitch
You watch me while I painted her, I ( Ball so hard )
They hate to see me on the stage Jay-Z, Kanye with me
You know I ( ball so hard ), TIP is scary
Merci beaucoup in Paris
Parlez vous francais I say, Menage a trois today I say
I ( ball so hard ), hard out the park
Maybach chauffeured, I ain't got to park
So Ross
, so official dawg
Them lame can't do nothing with you dawg
She all on me, better get your broad
Don't like that, blow your whistle dawg, I ( ball so hard )
No referee throw no flag, ain't no techs for me
I keep them suckas upset with me
Them racks back on deck you best believe that I

[Chorus: JAY-Z, Kanye West & T.I. ]
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
( Cray Ye, haa )
B-ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
( What Ye? Yeah, yeah, go, ayy )

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
So I ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a mothafucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets to BK

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Kanye West ]
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

[Verse 3: Kanye West & JAY-Z ]
She said, "Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all"
( Ball so hard ) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
( B-ball so hard ) What she order, fish fillet?
( B-ball so hard ) "Your whip so cold" – this old thing?
( Ball so hard ) Act like you'll ever be around mothafuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand
Fuck that bitch; she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right if you ask me
'Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

[Interlude: Jimmy MacElroy & Chazz Michael ]
"I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going"

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me

[Outro: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Both ]
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
( I got that hot bitch in my home )
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
( I'm definitely in my zone )

I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin' up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hub City beat
'87 baby
, '87 Cudi screamin' out "Fuck the police"
Bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat
Get your top peeled back, don't chitter-chat, don't speak of me
I move low-key, I think like a double OG
Inside of an old school bumpin' oldies
So high off life, that bitch I could OD
Die twice, and come back the same nigga
Lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga
Before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga
Me propane niggas for their dividends
Fuck if you innocent, Compton, all of my uncles wore Pendletons
West Coast rider, bitch, I'mma ride her
'Til the wheels fall off, buy more tires
Mmm, say hello to the new prince
I'm high king behind black tint
Na'mean?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Get the fuck out of my business
'Cause I've been handling the fuck out of my business
Grinding got perfect attendance
Flyer than first-class and detention
Uh, been a winner since the beginning
And my records show, not even in the Guinness
What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started
But you're on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, new born baby? and it's my party
And I'm kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrarri
Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope?
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
Open for criticism, but really is it any room for criticism?
When this shit is in 'em is deeper than your pool, so I swim in toilets
Bitch, I be and I been ballin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin' up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Mmm, fuck 'em all, kill 'em all off
Send 'em off to the holy one
Put a hole in one, like miniature golf
Price on your head, and they trying to purchase
No matter the cost
Hand over the cloth
Cloth over the gun
Gun over your jaw
Bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung
Every time I get a chance to come over, I overcome
Over the snare drums
They say, "Who fucking with you if you the god MC?"
I tell 'em nun
Get it? I tell 'em nun
Catholic nor Christian, holding the Book of Psalms
In the back of my True Religions
Never passed the bar but
I ain't got to study law
Just to judge lyrics
Mmm, I should be the judge of lyrics
Bang the gavel, give you a life sentence

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin' up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top

Count Me Out (Music Video) Lyrics

[Therapy Session: Helen Mirren and Kendrick Lamar]
Clock
Ticking

[Skit: Helen Mirren & Kendrick Lamar ]
Kendrick? Kendrick?
Did you hear that, Kendrick?
Um, yes, um
My apologies I thought my time was up
No, we can continue if you'd like
So, what did you say to the lady in the parking structure?

[Skit: Kendrick & Ladie ]
You took my damn parking spot!
I told her I didn't take your damn parking spot

[Skit: Helen Mirren & Kendrick Lamar ]
And how did that make you feel, reacting that way?
I felt decent
Oh! How come?
Because I did take her parking spot
Helen and Kendrick both begin laughing
No
You texted me at 2 o'clock in the morning, "I feel like I'm fallin"
Why do you feel that way?
Life
Music Begins

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's when I unite
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?
Fuck, Man!
(And I'm tripping and falling)
It's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
Sleep, I ain't never had affairs with that
What's fair when the hearts and the words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
(And I'm tripping and falling)
I care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much
I
shut down too, I ain't there too much
I'm a complex soul, they layered me up
Then broke me down, and morality's dust, I lack in trust
(And I'm tripping and falling)
This time around, I trust myself
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Look myself in the mirror
Amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
I fought like a pitbull terrier
Blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, "Carry 'em"
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived
Even my strong points couldn't survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me
(And I'm tripping and falling)
(And I'm tripping and falling)
(And I'm tripping and falling)
(And I'm-)

My president is black, my Maybach too
And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
And I'm headed for D.C., anybody feel me?
My president is black, my Maybach too
And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
And I'm headed for D.C., anybody feel me?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
My president is black, in fact he's half-white
So even in a racist mind he's half right
If you have racist mind you'll be a'ight
My President is black, but his house is all white
Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk
Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run
Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly
So I'ma spread my wings, you can meet me in the sky
I already got my own clothes, already got my own shoes
I was hot before Barack, imagine what I'm gonna do
Hello Miss America, hey pretty lady
Red, white, and blue flag, wave for me, baby
Never thought I'd say this shit, baby, I'm good
You can keep your puss, I don't want no more Bush
No more war, no more Iraq
No more white lies, the president is black

[Hook]
My president is black, my Maybach too
And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
And I'm headed for D.C., anybody feel me?
My president is black, my Maybach too
And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
And I'm headed for D.C., anybody feel me?

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Good morning, America, sorry I woke ya
I just had to say what's on my mind, like Oprah
Got the whole world like wide open, his mouth
Same reason during Katrina that he opened his house
Helped raise food, helped raise water so
God knows who can feed their son or their daughter
Say what I wanna say cause I'ma say, say it
Say what I'm gonna say cause I'm a taxpayer
Bill O'Reilly, eat a dick, nice try
You're really being a racist asshole in a nice tie
And tell Dennis Miller his show suck anyway
And I rather watch Jimmy Kimmel any day
I got some white friends and a white Benz
Parked out front and, yeah, also white rims
'Cept my president is black and I'ma be heard
Don't ever try to tell me now I can't say the b word
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamn if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my jewels light gray
I'm in a lux t-white, nah I much too paid
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamn if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my jewels light gray
I'm in a lux t-white, nah I much too paid
(How much did you pay?)
My president is black
My Blackberry is too though by the way

[Intro]
Woo! Uhh, uhh
It's
The Gift and the Curse
Uhh, uhh, yeah
First they love me then they hate me then they love me again
They love me again (Uhh)
Let's take a trip down
I got y'all

[Verse]
Let's take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain, grey skies, seems at the end of every
Young black life is this line, "Damn, him already?
Such a good kid," got us pourin' Henn' already
Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above
When it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love
So give BIG a hug, tell Aaliyah I said, "Hi"
'Til the next time I see her, on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him 'cause, in him, we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn
Poor Isis, that's his mama name
Mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?
Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him
Hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him
Isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him
Damn near impossible, only men can raise men
He was his own man, not even him can save him
He put his faith in a .38 in his waist
But when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate
End up dead before 38 and umm
That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world
Ol' girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away
Isis' life just ended on that rainy day
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed
Down at the city morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude
Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew
Angel dust dipped in woo!
She slipped into her own fantasy world
Had herself pregnant by a different dude
But reality bites and this is her life
He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife
It was just this night when moon was full
And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight
Had her soundin' like
Lisa Lisa
I wonder if I take you home, will you still love me
after this night?
Mike was the hard head from around the way
That she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype
Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
He was a Willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like
It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
But Isis liked this Broadway life
She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red, green and whites
Hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight
She was so turned on that she had to shower twice
How ironic it would be some fight that
Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life
See Mike at 32 was still on the scene
Had a son, 15, that he never saw twice
Sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like
"If that was my son, he would look much different
See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark"
So it's mama's baby, papa's maybe
Mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets (Fuck niggas want?)
Had his old reliable .38 gun in his reach
It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak
He runnin' around like life's a peach
'Til one day, he approached this thug that had a mean mug
And it looked so familiar that he called him "Young Cuz"
Told him get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (Fuck you)
Instead he pulled out a newer .38 snub
He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (Hold up)
There was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before
It's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' his self more mature
And he took it as a sign from the Almighty Lord
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war
(What's that?) He who hesitates is lost
He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank
The old man didn't think, he just followed his instinct
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas be a father, you're killin' your son
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons

[Outro]
Meet the parents
(The parents, the parents, the parents)
(The parents, the parents, the parents, the parents)
(The parents, the parents, the parents, the parents)
(The parents, the parents, the parents, the parents, the parents)

squabble up (Video Version) Lyrics

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
God knows
I am reincarnated
I was stargazin'
Life goes on, I need all my babies (Gyah, gyah)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Debbie Deb ]
Woke up lookin' for the broccoli
High-key, keep a horn on me, that Kamasi
IP, ownership, the blueprint is by me
Mr. Get Off, I get off at my feet
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, now is your chance
A
yee
nigga couldn't try me in the tri-state
Buddy pass, bet I get him
splashed
'til he hydrated
Bounce out, know he spook town, eyes dilated
I got the money and the power both gyratin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safe
Mando, let me know what the play

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What the fuck?
I got hits, I got bucks, I got new paper cuts
I got friends, I got foes, but they all sitting ducks
Hit his turf and get crackin', double back like a deluxe
Fifty deep, but it ain't deep enough
Fuck a plea, there he go, beat him up
Fallin' from my money tree and it grow throughout the months
Spit a loogie at the camera, speed off
, yeah,
it's us

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safe
Mando, let me know what the play

Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up (Mm, mm)
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up

Hol' up (Hol' up)
Bring it in the tuck (Bring it in the tuck)

Tender sauce (Tender sauce)
Walk on trays (Walk on trays)
It don't gust (It don't gust)
Fee-fi (Fee-fi)
Sighted in the tub (Sighted in the tub)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, baby rockin' it
Quid pro quo, what you
want
? 'Cause I'm watchin' it
Work on the floor, let me know if you clockin' it
Brodie won't go, but I know that he poppin' it
It was wolf tickets on sale 'til I silenced it
Pipe down, young, these some whole other politics
Bitch with him and some bitch in him, that's a lot of bitch
Don't hit him, he got kids with him, my apologies
Ghetto child, it was Black & Milds with the Smirnoff
Yeehaw, we outside, whoadie 'bout to kill him off
Blaps on blaps, it's a fact, this a brick of raw
Tell me why the fuck you niggas rap if it's fictional?
Tell me why the fuck you niggas fed if you criminal?
"Ayy, Dot, can I get a drop?" I'm like, "Nigga, nah"
Ace boon coon from the Westside to Senegal
It's a full moon, let the wolves out, I been a dog (Ah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safe
Mando, let me know what the play

Any given time's, a hundred G's in your grill
Don't talk to me 'bout emcees got skills
He's all right, but he's not real
,
Jay-Z's that deal, with Sigs in the field
Love affair for war—hug, squeeze that steel
Fuck—you got a flow? That's cool with me
You got a little dough? That's cool with me
You got a little cars, little jewelries
But none of y'all muh'fuckers could fool with me
You know the wrist frostbit minus two degrees
'Bout as blue as the sea, the way I maneuver the V
Hat cocked, can't see his eyes—who could it be?
With that new, blue Yankee on—who but me?
Niggas shipped two million, then I blew the three
Then I skated the four 'fore I went on tour
I came back and it's plain: y'all niggas ain't rappin' the same
Fuck the flow—y'all jackin' our slang
I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrows, tryna wild out
The game is ours—we'll never foul out
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out
Throw your hands up—niggas, bitches, busters
Hustlers, fuck that! ( Throw they hands up )
C'mon!

[Chorus: Amil, Jay-Z , Barron Ricks sample & Amil & Jay-Z ]
12 a.m., on the way to the club ( Throw they hands up , Uh huh )

3 a.m., now he buyin' me drinks ( What she drinkin' on? )
4 a.m., exit the club ( Throw they hands up , Let's go )

12 a.m., I'ma do it again
Ugh, ugh, I'ma do it again
12 a.m.

I’m In It Lyrics

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Bridge: Assassin]
That's all dem can do, say wah?
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
'Cause a badman ting a-dat man do
Action ting, yo, a badman ting

[Verse 2: Assassin]
I'm a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way José
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We a gon' smile 'pon court day
'Cuh we beat murder charge like O.J

[Chorus: Kanye West & Justin Vernon ]
That's right, I'm in it
( Should've known how to fall )
I'm in it ( Steppin' on cracks on the floor )
That right ( 8 a.m., boy, set your tone )
That's right, I'm in it ( Well, you need to fight when you're alone )
That's right, I'm in it ( Then don't let me at your table )
I'm in it ( If you just gonna lay with me )
Damn right, uh
( Just jokes at the end of your little fables )
( I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes )

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh,
she love
different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like, "Ah!"

[Chorus: Assassin, Kanye West , & Justin Vernon ]
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
That's all dem can do, say wah?
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
'Cause a badman ting a-dat man do
That's right, I'm in it
I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Say you long for me, for you
Lay it off with all your rules
Star fucker
Star fucker
Star fucker
Who, where?

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Time to take it too far now, uh
Michael Douglas out the car now, uh
Got the kids-and-the-wife life, uh
But can't wake up from the nightlife, uh
I'm so scared of my demons, uh
I go to sleep with a nightlight, uh
My mind move like a Tron bike, uh
Pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist, uh
I'm finna start a new movement, uh
Being led by the drums, uh
I'm a rap-lic priest, uh
Gettin' head by the nuns, uh
They don't play what I'm playin', uh
They don't see what I'm sayin', uh
They be ballin' in the D-League, uh
I be speakin' Swaghili

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD
If you like me you reading the credits right now
If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter
I want you to put all your windows down
Zone out, buckle up, let's go

[Verse: Jay-Z]
Hello it's Hova;
that's right young'un the wait is over
The new millennium is upon us, the album is here
Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear
Rappers with no relation:
There's "Seven Degrees of Separation" and I'm Kevin Bacon
This is the murderer's version
Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
Hova the God, I should be rapping with a turban
Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
Mike Jordan of rap, outside Jay working
Now watch how quickly I drop 50
I don't like playing, niggas can't stick me
Niggas can not jam me, niggas can't get me
Slimmy at the Rucker wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take em out the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe? It's Hova the God

[Outro: Pain In Da Ass]
Makes you think about the people in your life
Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here
He'd say, "Jay, what's it about? What's life about?
If you don't go through as a man's a man"
He'd say, "Suck it up, take the fall, do the time
That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are"
How many years you been around this thing of ours?
Commission, 125 years
What's it about?
It's about rules, parameters
You take the beating for the friend you don't lay down
You don't betray who you are, what you are
You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
They don't roar, they don't rap
You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them
You was born to be something I wasn't even supposed to be.. humble
Okay so you humble me now, what you got?
You got a war, you got global war
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now
There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings
There's no feelings for this game
So.. five, ten years from now
You're gonna wish there was American Commission
Five, ten years from now
They're gonna miss Jay-Z
OKAY, I'M RELOADED!

[Intro]
Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike
( Stretch my hands to You )
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
( Stretch my hands to You )
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal
( Father, I stretch )
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life
( Stretch my hands to You )
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad
( Stretch my hands to You )
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"

Kendrick Lamar: Rapper of the Year - GQ Lyrics
Kendrick Lamar sits down with GQ writer Steve Marsh as he talks with the “Rapper of the Year”.
Reminder that you can click the images for more annotations.
Every member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013—Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem
—
but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses
:
Kendrick Lamar, the latest—and possibly greatest—rapper to come straight outta Compton.
We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby
Death Row Records that originally signed him
, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.
It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his "little bro"—a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.
So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. "It all happened when I was overseas," he says. "I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed."
It's been a strange year.
When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds—one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever—and since then his legend has spread fast.
It actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim.
The album—about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing "that crazy-ass girl Sherane"—is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest—
the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house
—and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast—
Beach House samples
, Dungeon Family lushness—but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:
If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Good kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer.
Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song "Control"—a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record.
After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit,
Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game:
Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself.
The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself "the king of New York," which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.
"Control" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.
Kendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it "back to the set" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. "It can be complicated and confusing," Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. "From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous—I still live in this world." And when someone back home needs something, "I still gotta get that phone call."
It's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.
A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: "When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow."
Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000.
Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: "Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy.
"
On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over "Control" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on "Control," and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal,
because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album
. After Drake's VMA performance of "Hold On, We're Going Home," Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. "You watch," he joked, "I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!"
I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. "Pretty cool." Shrugs. "And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't."
A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the "Control" thing: "You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'—pretending like nothing ever happened." Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped "Control" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.
I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out—"Control" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. "Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis," Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, "No—peer. If anything. We all peers."
When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.
"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now—it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette."
The visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. "It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin'," he explains. "I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle."
Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times.
Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze.
In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. "When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows," he says. "But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman."
A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, "Aw, man, I can't go to no club."
Kendrick spoke up.
"We have to go."
"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go."
"You know me," Kendrick explained. "I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!"
Twenty minutes later, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. "You guys seem so calm," I said.
"Well," Tiffith told me, "we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand."
The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati—Jay, Bey—
mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the "King of New York" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos.
Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. "It was all love at that party," he told me on the private jet.
After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: "We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas."
By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for "Swimming Pools (Drank)," a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency—Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK—a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.
It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. "I don't know," he says. "It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be."
At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, "I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.

[Intro: Kanye West & Jeezy ]
La, la, la-la
( Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry,
more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jeezy ]
La, la, la-la ( Ayy! )
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la-la ( Yeah! )
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing ( Yeah! Haha! )
You can't tell me nothing ( Yeah! Yeah! )
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing ( Yeah! )

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life, homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day"
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
Aight, man, holla, then

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jeezy ]
La, la, la-la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la-la ( Yeah! )
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada,
Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like, "Why, God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jeezy ]
La, la, la-la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la-la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Outro: Kanye West & Jeezy ]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
( I'm serious, nigga , I got money )

Great Hova
Y'all already know what it is! (Oh shit!)
C'mon! (Woooo!)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So what if you flip a couple words? I could triple that in birds
Open your mind, you see the circus in the sky
I'm Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey
with the pies
No matter how you slice it,
I'm your motherfuckin' guy
And just like a b-boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige
Whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar
Whip it around, it still comes back hard
So easily do I W-H-I-P
My repetition with wristses'll bring the kilo bidness
I got Creole C.O. bitches for my niggas
Who slipped, became prisoners, treats taped to the visitors
You already know what the bid-ness is
Unnecessary commissary, boy, we live this shit
Niggas wanna bring the '80s back
That's okay with me, that's where they made me at
Except I don't write on the wall
I write my name in the history books, hustlin' in the hall
Nah, I don't spin on my head
I spin my work in the pot, so I can spend my bread

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell ]
And I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it
I ain't talkin' about it, I'm livin' it
I'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
G—G—G—Get— Get— Get it, boy
Don't waste your time
Fighting the life
Stay your course
And you'll understand
(Get it, boy)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
It's '87 state of mind that I'm in (mind that I'm in)
In my prime, so for that time, I'm Rakim (I'm Rakim)
If it wasn't for the crime that I was in
But I wouldn't be the guy who rhymes it is that I'm in (that I'm in)
No pain, no profit
P, I repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is)
Cherry M3's with the top back (top back)
Red and green G's all on my hat
North Beach leathers
, matching Gucci sweater
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game?
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra
I ran contraband that they sponsored
Before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell ]
And I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it
I ain't talkin' about it, I'm livin' it
I'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
G—G—G—Get— Get— Get it, boy
Don't waste your time
Fighting the life
Stay your course
And you'll understand
(Get it, boy)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Ugh, push
Money over broads,
you got it—fuck Bush
Chef, guess what I cooked?
Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books
Rock star, look
Way before the bars, my picture was getting took
Feds, they like wack rappers
Try as they may, they couldn't get me on the hook, ugh
D.A. wanna indict me
'Cause fishscale's in my veins like a Pisces
The Pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves
Turn one into two like a Siamese twin
When it end,
I'ma stand as a man
Never dying on my knees, last of a dying breed
So let the champagne pop
I partied for a while – now, I'm back to the block

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell ]
And I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it
I ain't talkin' about it, I'm livin' it
I'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
G—G—G—Get— Get— Get it, boy
Don't waste your time
Fighting the life
Stay your course
And you'll understand
(Get it, boy)

[Outro: Denzel Washington from American Gangster ]
"'Blue Magic'—that's a brand name. Like 'Pepsi'—that's a brand name. I stand behind it. I guarantee it. They know that, even if they don't know me any more than they know the— the Chairman of General Mills. My man..."

Ma— I ain't gotta tell you, but it's your boy Hov
From the U.S.—you just lay down slow
Catch your boy, mingle in England, meddling in the Netherlands
Checking in daily under aliases
We rebellious, we back home
Screaming, "Leave Iraq alone!"
But all my soldiers in the field, I will wish you safe return
But only love kills war—when will they learn?
It's International Hov,
been having the flow
Before Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow
Before Ronald Reagan got Manhattan the blow
Before, I was cabbing it there, back and forth
Raw, we had it all day, Papi in the hallway (What up, man?)
Cop one on consignment to give you more yay'
Yeah, but that's another stor-ay
But for now, mami, turn it around, and let the boy play

And you say, New York City!
Uh-huh
Put your hands together
Young!
Uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yes! (Yes!)

[Verse 1]
I'm from the '80s
Home of the her-on
Era of the hustlers, uh
The world is my custies
New Rich Porter
The way I flip quarters
Front on all these other rap artists, but me
Momma was a mink wearer, Papa ran numbers
So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream,
I'm living the life still
Way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, Army jacket lining
40 Below Timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friend's gone
I seen bad days, still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige "Reminisce" on
I hear his voice in my mind like, "Nigga, live on"
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high, nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
I'm give it to my sons
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh
6's kitted up – man, I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the Hall of Fame
A list of hits next to all my names
I came

[Bridge]
(Woo!) Uh-huh (Gyeah)
I want the sky, baby
I want the sky, baby

[Verse 2]
If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow, and they foreclose on the house
And auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me, Argentina
–
I mobbed the Bimmer
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardinia
In Ibiza, I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
"Billie Jean – the goddamn boy ain't mine"
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Rose gold, Rosé flow, I'm okay though
What don't kill me makes stronger than before, so
"Here we go" – and I'm not Domino
When it "All Falls Down," I'm like Kanye's jaw – I might break, but I don't fold
'Til I hold the sky in my hand
– yeah, that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture, ture
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
My name will be viewed as such
Here's to the man who refused to give up
I want the sky, nigga – chuuurch

I want the sky, baby
I want the sky, baby

[Intro]
We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all, we at war with ourselves

[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)

[Verse 1]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next, these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well, mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope

[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus, walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus, walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus, walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus, walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
So long, so long
(Jesus, walk with me)

[Verse 2]
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks with them)
To the victims of welfare, feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks with them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?
Well, if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' 'bout
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

Some People Hate Lyrics

[Intro]
That old fashioned word
It's a word called love
Called looooove
Called looo-oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo-ove

[Refrain]
Oh, this must be the way the nigga Pac felt when he made
Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me
Y'all niggas got me feelin' like all eyes on me, me against the world
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit
Thought niggas would appreciate what I did to this game
Being that I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggas would appreciate what I came and did
Since ninety-six, every year
Something must be seriously wrong with the world
I know y'all ain't hating

[Chorus]
( Some people hate ) Don't tell me niggas is hating
( Some people hate ) Uhh, nah, you know what I think?
( Some people hate ) I think...
( I think they've lost their minds ) Think y'all lost your mind
Y'all got me on my shit

[Verse 1]
Raw, rough and rugged, when addressing the mass public
My attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it
Got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck being famous, I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter, my success in this game
Is sort of like Pro-jectic Justice
A payment for brushes with police officers
A peace offering from the Gods for the streets I was tossed in
Til I'm deceased in a coffin
I'ma be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon change the numbers
It's the strengthening of chain among us
Please we ain't afraid of none of ya's; who want it with us?
Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon

[Chorus]
( Some people hate ) Gyeah, uh, yeah
( Some people hate ) Uh, uh, uh
( Some people hate ) Yeah! You know what I think?
( I think they've lost their minds ) They say success breeds envy

[Verse 2]
I guess it's just the penalty of leadership
I guess I'm what niggas wanna be and shit
Or niggas just bored wanna be in shit
'Fore they get to rappin', start believing it, think they Ali and shit
I roll with the punches so I survive
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise, surprise
They try to take me out the game but I's alive
It's like a old Negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey
With a splash of Monster Kody,
shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
You bastards know me, the one and only
Big homie from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life
It's either that or y'all gon' make me
Put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga

[Chorus]
( Some people hate )
I know nigga's ain't hating man, let me find out
( Some people hate )
Jealousy is a weak emotion, you gotta overcome that, man
( Some people kill their brothers )
C'mon man, be stronger than that.. you know what I think?
( I think they've lost their minds ) You'll be alright though

[Verse 3]
Au contraire, nigga, I am here 'cause I earned this shit
By riding out when niggas had learners' permit
We bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
I bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out
Turn your six, I laid back in the Maybach
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggas from way back
Niggas wanna clown, but the pound, it don't play that
Get yourself found drowned where the lake at
Run up on 'em notoriously, take that, take that
And then we coming where your wake at
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that
Face facts, fake rap cats
Can't take back what I took back to the Brook, look

[Chorus]
Some people hate
Some people hate
Some people kill their brothers
I think they've lost their minds

[Outro]
And I'm hung up.. ohh..

LMAO Lyrics
A song by Kendrick Lamar made back in 2008 (when he was known as K.Dot).

[Intro]
Wow
I think I must have forgot or something
Like I ain't hot or something
Like I don't make your girl take off her top or something

[Chorus]
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

[Verse 1]
Jump in the coup and I'm gone
I smell like money, I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak
That can jump on the bone
Like an X-Ray technician
My rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs
All cause I'm 21
Like playing blackjack
Picture this kodak
Moment forever
K.Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite
I'm that cool

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

[Chorus]
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

[Verse 2]
Bottle of goose and I'm gone
Watching her get loose
Like a third graders tooth
The shit that we on
Is the ultimate high
Double XL flow
That's the ultimate vibe
Park that Lambi' outside
Just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lami' in drive
Watch 'em peel like potatoes
Holla' LMAO
When they drunk and two-step
Like I never could pass
A sobriety test

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

[Chorus]
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

[Verse 3]
I'm in the club I can manage
Providing lenses
Make my view panoramic
I'm out of this world
I'm off of this planet
They don't say K.Dot is here
They say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted
Like a kitchen floor
But my floor is marble
I ride in the carpool because I got two whores
In the back of that chrome
See they're all I need
Like Aaliyah alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

[Chorus]
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha

Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play

[Verse]
Welcome to the wild side, Hub city's wild side
Where tecs fly that's homicide, my stacks like a mile high
Fly as a bitch, got a condo on cloud 9
Slap box with God, jump off heaven and skydive
So supernatural K.dot come and see me on Sci-Fi
From 5-6 with five nines two mac-10s and Glock nines
Lets do this however whenever tell em I'm ready
Waters run deep way before Katrina broke the levee
Look partner, I'm no gangster, I'm no killer
But please believe I know plenty gangsters that'll kill ya
I don't like you, I don't feel ya you're very unfamiliar
So please build your catalog before I knock your cattle off
This saddle off on a red horse that's a red Porsche
That's not your favorite rapper in the booth
That's a dead corpse once K.dot kick chaos
Niggas bitch off like canines click up and click, click, click boom
Smell the fumes on my Levis
Bitches poppin' pills and mushrooms in my hotel rooms
I squeeze dick through their thick thighs then bounce like this beat from T.Dot
Six T.Vs in my new SUV F-U-C-K-Y-O-U pay me
Or pay me no attention and meet the criminal henchmen
Genesis ain't shit, I know local henchmen
Come shoot me I'm in a two seater with hootie, motherfucker

[Hook]
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side

[Intro]
I don't know what life will be in H-I-P H-O-P
Without the boy H-O-V
Not only NYC, I'm hip-hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, I'm ready
When kingdom come I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Now everywhere I go they like, "Hov, come back"
Up out the corner office, out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim? He was the coldest cat
Get your swag back, daddy, where your focus at?
Got to admit a little bit, I was sick of rap
But despite that, the boy is back
And I'm so evolved, I'm so involved
I'm showing growth,
I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and, yeah, glory to God
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded selling blow in the park –
This I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened, I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office, you might know him as Clark
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I, take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth, Superman is alive

[Chorus]
The King of New York, New York
Not only NYC, I'm hip-hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, uh huh
Not only NYC, I'm hip-hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor

[Verse 2]
I hear "hurry up, Hov'" when I'm out in the public
'Cause niggas like, "But you love it – you be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas"
Had to dust off the Hammer dance, can't touch this
C'mon, playboys, bring the cars back out
'Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinkin'
I thought dude's remark was rude, okay?
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Rosé
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel 'em from the bottom
Underdog, before my cape, still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
Peter Park', Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts

[Chorus]
The King of New York, New York
Not only NYC, I'm hip-hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, uh huh
Not only NYC, I'm hip-hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor

[Verse 3]
Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that?
Guess what New York, New York – we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South
"'Bout It, 'Bout It," Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homie Bun B
I run the streets, the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill, still waters run deep
I repeat, sing along with me
I run the streets, the streets don't run we
Ladies saying, "Where you been, Superman?"
When niggas spending ten million in media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game, have no fear
When you need me just throw your Roc signs in the air, yeah!

[Chorus]
The King of New York, New York
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip-hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, uh huh
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip-hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor

[Intro: Jay-Z]
The Watcher!
Gyeah, ugh
Shit I do for a livin', nigga
Shit I eat for a livin', nigga ( The Watcher! )
That's how I live for a livin', nigga
I'm watching
'Kay, let's do this
The Watcher!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
But I'm a lil' too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespectin' the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting in Pampers
I was moving them grams 'fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was
Ducking the vans, radars, and scanners
Before you knew what hard white or tan was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, 'cause I'm hype with them hammers
I was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a fam' was
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mil' later—now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night?
Grand, fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was putting Peter Pan up in your room
Y'all fuckin' with whom?
Allow me to retort
You cowards is just now learnin' the shit that we taught
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
'Bout a high-speed Porsche
I.E., you niggas ain't know how to floss
'Til I came through the door like "Eric B. for Prez"
Respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us 'cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking 'em so long, fucking your lil' neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hef', but you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggas that got life really like what I sing
‘Cause they know what it's really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I don't write
Be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game
Word to the hyphen in my name!
J-A-Y – dash – Hoffa
The past, present, nigga, the future, proper
The Holy Trinity in Hip-Hop is us
We give Dre his props, but that's where it stops
It's the Roc!

[Pre-Chorus: Truth Hurts]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all

[Chorus: Terri]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still droppin' flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top, had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all – how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre – haters want a stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through
the eyes of the man
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane, the odds that I played
The best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher

[Pre-Chorus: Truth Hurts]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all

[Chorus: Terri]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

[Verse 3: Rakim]
I'm rated R, my brain contains graphic things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
It's like watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic—the object? A fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
Take away to add a profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open—The Watcher

[Pre-Chorus: Truth Hurts]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all

[Chorus: Terri]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

[Outro]
The Watcher
The Watcher
I'm watching, The Watcher
Bah, bah, The Watcher
The Watcher

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Oh, baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Turn the motherfuckin' music up

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get
down
, get up, I get
down
Get up, I get
down
, get up, I get
down
Get up, I get
down
, get up, I get down

[Over Chorus: JAY-Z]
That's right, it's what I do!
C'mon
, uh-huh
Nah, you know I never let you down!
Gyeah, gyeah, yuh

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Yo, first, I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First, I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya, boy

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get
down
, get up, I get
down
Get up, I get
down
, get up, I get
down
Get up, I get
down
, get up

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather
who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get
down
, get up, I get
down
Get up, I get
down
, get up, I get
down
Get up, I get
down
, get up, I get down

[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental,
vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop
,
that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down

[Verse 4: JAY-Z & (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special
(Woo-hoo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
Dissin' Jay, dissin' Jay'll get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please, Father forgive us'
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive

What The Deal Lyrics
Kendrick is rapping over the instrumental to Lloyd Banks “Work Magic” off of his “The Hunger For More” album. Track 2 off his debue mixtape: Youngest Head Nigga in Charge

[Intro]
Uh-huh, yeah
You know what it is
Uh-uh
It's that Compton shit, nigga
Get back, uh
I tell you, I swear it's-

[Chorus]
If I gotta ride (O-O-O-Okay, uh)
Then he's gonna die (O-O-O-Okay, duck, niggas)

[Interlude]
Uh (Get back)
Let me talk to 'em
Listen

[Verse]
I hope niggas ain't really tryin' to break my bones
'Cause if you are, make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone
Play hard as a rock, bullets can break stones
Break bad boys down like Jenny did Sean Combs
I'm hot as an oven, you just a pressin' comb
I'm not impressed homes, you should've stayed home
And prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin' shitted on
I gives a fuck if A&R's don't pick up the phone, huh
I swear there's no one like me
But if it is, then I got a long lost twin, or they made me a clone
I don't care about friends, I was made to be on my own
I came in this world by myself, and I'm leavin' alone
Hopefully with a crib that I can call my own
With a backyard the size of the fuckin' Georgia Dome, pop
You pop shit, then I might pop your dome
Give your homies a reason to make a memory song, huh
Niggas swear that they love when the beef is on
Knowin' that plummet time the only time he'll roam
You better hold your breath, I give you walkin' death
And recommend the gun bein' your chaperone
I know young niggas that look up to Al Capone
And they look seventeen, but I swear that their mind is grown, shit
I'm so grown and the reason why I write this way
Pac and Big be ghostwritin' my songs, huh
You can play the boss
But if you get shot from bein' on top
Then, homie, that's your loss, shit
I'm nice wit' it
I'll pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs, get it?
The niggas tryin' to get money like Fort Knox
Either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock
And you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor
Yeah, somethin' like Rick Fox, huh
You ain't a thug, homie, you just a fox
In the midst of werewolves somewhere in the Boondocks
And I'm really from the streets
So if I ask for beef, homeboy, don't bring me no pork chop
I turn your skin to pork, homie, with one chop
With a rusty switchblade that's dirty like bum socks, ha
They say the flow is crack
So wherever I rap, best believe you can call it a dope spot, bitch, bitch, I swear

[Chorus]
I'm gon' ride (Yeah, y'all know what it is)
And he's gotta die (Uh, bitch)

[Outro]
It's that Compton shit, niggas (Get back)
Uh, oh K.Dot (Huh, uh huh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh K.Dot
Money by any means, nigga
<|song_end|>
<|song_start|>
[Verse]
So I’m the bad guy now I hear, because I don’t go with the flow
Don’t ever go with the flow, be the flow
And I don’t need no middle man to talk to my niggas
I understand if you don’t understand, I figure I’m Jigga
That’s where we differ
I take what’s mine, you accept what they give you, I get you
I don’t take no checks I take my respect
Pharrell even told me go with the safest bet
Jimmy Iovine offered a safety net
Google dangled around a crazy check
I feel like YouTube is the biggest culprit
Them niggas pay you a tenth of what you supposed to get
You know niggas die for equal pay right?
You know when I work I ain't your slave right?
You know I ain't shucking and jiving and high fiving
You know this ain't back in the days right?
But I can't tell, how the way they killed Freddie Gray right
Shot down Mike Brown how they did Tray right?
Let them continue choking niggas
We gon' turn style, I ain't your token nigga
You know I came in this game independent right?
TIDAL, my own label, same difference
Oh niggas is skeptical when it's their own shit
You bought nine iPhones and Steve Jobs is rich
Phil Knight worth trillions you still bought those kicks
Spotify is nine billion they ain't say shit
Lucy you got some 'splaining to do
The only one they hating on look the same as you
That's cool, I know they trying to bamboozle you
Spending millions on media trying to confuse you
I had to talk to myself, Hov you used to it
It's politics as usual

Put That On Somethin’ Lyrics

[Intro]
Ay, baby, lemme holla at you
I’m a boss, baby! (You liar!)
Baby, I’ma-I’ma-I’m a boss! (You liar!)
Baby, come on, lemme holla at you
P. Diddy my cousin! (You liar!)
We related through marriage, baby, I luh you! (You liar!)
DJ Dave made this track (You liar!)
K. Dot? He is wack (You liar!)
(You liar!)

[Verse 1]
Now listen my friends, not to offend
But this is a story told over again
So many niggas tryin' to fuck with the Ken
But the only problem is they can't win
I gets down my younging
Please turn it up just to sound, my youngin
I burned it up, that's your town, my youngin
Either the cake or the trait bound, my youngin
This the brand new trunk
Rattling, beat tackling
Big truck paddling
Dime piece beauty peagant-ing
Pick 'em up then they (uh) saddling
They bus travelling
K. Dot, that boy got the crazy flow
Maybach, the 1964
With my brim kind of tilted low
So fresh, oh yes, it's me suppose

[Hook]
I got a house on the hill
Put that on somethin'
Put that on somethin', man
Put that on somethin'
26 inch rims
Put that on somethin'
Put that on somethin', man
Put that on somethin'
I got a pocket full of bills
Put that on somethin'
Put that on somethin', man
Put that on somethin' (You liar!)
I put that on everything I love (You liar!)
You lie to me, fly too much
And that's on me

[Verse 2]
I move quick enough for your eyes won't see
That boy hussled up, everything for cheap
These chickens tryin' to plot on a boy
So a nigga gotta move kinda low
(Low what?) Low key
I put 26 inch rims on the ride
Big truck fit five chicks at a time
Stones big enough you can go rock climb
Put that on somethin'
Nah, man, I was lying
But tell me what you know about it, know about it?
Fat camp I can't go without it, go without it
This ain't hot, I truly doubt it
Mapped out the whole game so reroute it
‘Cause look here, boo, you fucking with a champion
K. Dot the don, moving the blocks you on
Taking the spot of Shawn, I'm on top, you're on
Industry remember me, 'cause I so crazy

[Hook]
I got a house on the hill
Put that on somethin'
Put that on somethin', man
Put that on somethin'
26 inch rims
Put that on somethin'
Put that on somethin', man
Put that on somethin'
I got a pocket full of bills
Put that on somethin'
Put that on somethin', man
Put that on somethin' (You liar!)
I put that on everything I love (You liar!)
You lie to me, fly too much
And that's on me

[Verse 3]
My mama, my daddy, my grams, grandpappy
This ain't rappin', nigga, this is a classic
This hard work, nigga, it just didn't happen
.44 magnum, put a nigga in his casket
K. Dot drastic, nigga, I am a savage
So quick to let a motherfucker have it
All the girlies like, “He so crazy
I wish daddy could have my baby”
I get with 'em, they like, “He so shady!”
They cry about it like, “He won't pay me”
Not a goddamn dime, mami
The dividends that's raked in, that's mine, mami
You wanna leave, then go ahead, it's fine, mami
K. Dot a magnet, to fine mamis
Plus I ain't hard to find, mami
Studio, yeah, we stays on the grind, mami

[Hook]
I got a house on the hill
Put that on somethin'
Put that on somethin', man
Put that on somethin'
26 inch rims
Put that on somethin'
Put that on somethin', man
Put that on somethin'
I got a pocket full of bills
Put that on somethin'
Put that on somethin', man
Put that on somethin' (You liar!)
I put that on everything I love (You liar!)
You lie to me, fly too much
And that's on me

[Outro]
Aye check this out
I just copped me that new H1 and H2 and H3
That H3 that new pickup and
That motherfucker sick right there
I stay in the Hills
The Hollywood Hills, next to Omarion
I got 26 inch wheels
I got a pool, inside of a pool (You liar!), inside of a jacuzzi
And I ain't lying (You liar!)
Man, I'm not lying
My sister got a jacuzzi in her bed, in her pool
That's how we living
That's on me
That's on everything I love

[Verse 1]
I think I just fell in love with a pornstar
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for Heaven's sakes, huh
Well, I'ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah

[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Verse 2]
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well, I guess a lotta niggas do gangbang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves
all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Verse 3]
One day, I'm gon' marry a pornstar
We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna roleplay 'til I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
'specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, "Get away"
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

[Bridge]
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights on
With the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck, fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on

[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Outro]
I think I fell in love with a pornstar
And got married in the bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life
( Mmm, mmm, mmm )
( Mmm, mmm, mmm )
( Mmm, mmm, mmm )
( Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm )
( Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm )

I'm tryna keep my faith
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
This is everything

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
We know we need it
You know we need it
You know we need it
That's why we need You now, oh
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents
This is a God dream

We on an ultralight beam

[Post-Chorus: The-Dream with Choir ]
I'm tryna keep my
faith
But I'm looking for
more
Somewhere I can feel
safe
And end my holy
war
I'm tryna keep my
faith

[Verse 2: Kelly Price & Choir ]
So why send oppression, not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? ( More )
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong ( Safe )
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light ( War )
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]
When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted, Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with '
Chance 3
'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West ]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

[Post-Chorus: The-Dream, The-Dream & Choir , Natalie Greene ]
( Yes, God )
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my
faith
( Yes, Jesus )
But I'm looking for
more
Somewhere I can feel
safe
And end my holy
war

[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir ]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yeah...
Come experience... life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Place: Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions: well, y'all know the actions

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uhh,
I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking
To honies hawking,
I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes,
I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle
Nobody want to be like Michael where I'm from
Just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek ]
It's time to come up ( and hold my own weight, defend my crown )
Gots to lock it down and when they rush ( stand my ground )
It's time to come up ( stick up my chest, and make some loot )
Gots to lock it down and when they rush ( stand on my own two )

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace
Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight.. balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day
And chasing crackheads up the block for my pay
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level
Pushing 'Vettes through the 'jects
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibrium
And stunned, I'm waiting for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge
I don't want a lifetime sentence
, just give me the word

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek ]
It's time to come up ( and hold my own weight, defend my crown )
Gots to lock it down and when they rush ( stand my ground )
It's time to come up ( stick up my chest, and make some loot )
Gots to lock it down and when they rush ( stand on my own two )

[Verse 3: Jay-Z and Memphis Bleek ]
Hey fella I been watching you clocking
Who me? Holding down this block? It ain't nothing
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Hahah, I like your style ( Nah, I like your style )
Let's drive around awhile!
Cool, nigga
Here's a thou',
A G? I ride with you for free
I want the long-term riches and bitches
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same
( On the low? ) Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly ( AND THEN YOU BLOW! )
Kid, keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards,
then he through dealing I understand
Don't blow your dough on hotties
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break 'em for nobody
Hah, I like your résumé, pick a day, you can start
From now until death do us part, nigga
(Right!)

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek ]
It's time to come up ( and hold my own weight, defend my crown )
Gots to lock it down and when they rush ( stand my ground )
It's time to come up ( and stick up my chest, and make some loot )
Gots to lock it down and when they rush ( stand on my own two )
It's time to come up ( and hold my own weight, defend my crown )
Gots to lock it down and when they rush ( stand my ground )
It's time to come up ( and stick up my chest, and make some loot )
Gots to lock it down and when they rush ( stand on my own two )

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I am a human who's probably gonna fall again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
I'mma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard the coast
Like this in a long time, don't you see that long line?
And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Lady Gaga]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream, "It's alive!"
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say, bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Intro]
Stress...
Sunshine, shade, geyeah

[Verse 1]
I sold it all, from crack to opium
In third person, I don't wanna see 'em
So I'm rehearsin' with my peoples how to G 'em
From a remote location in the BM
Scopin' the whole situation, like, "Damn!"
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em
The windows to his soul were half closed, I put the key in
Pulled off slow, hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars
Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time Warner
Awaitin' a call, from his kin, not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets?
(This time, stress, givin' this shit up, fuck)

[Chorus 1]
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets

[Verse 2]
As sure as this Earth is turnin', souls burnin'
In search of higher learnin'
, turnin' in every direction, seekin' direction
My mom's cryin', because her insides are dyin'
Her son tryin' her patience, keep her heart racin'
A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit
But it's this game Love, I'm caught up all in it
They make it so you can't prevent it
Never give it, you gotta take it, can't fake it, I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shakin'
'Cause I sense danger like Camp Crystal Lake and
Don't wanna shoot him
, but I got him trapped within this infrared dot
About to hot him and hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions, no time, shit's stressin'
My life found I got to live for the right now
Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
Once it's too late, got to learn to live with regrets

[Chorus 2]
You used to hold me, told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
(When I was young) you used to hold me
Told me I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets

[Verse 3]
I found myself reminiscin', remember this one?
When he was here he was crazy nice with his, son
I miss him, long as I'm livin' he's livin' through memories
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In Heaven lookin' over me, or in Hell keepin' it cozy
I'm comin', life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
Remember Newton, mutual friend? Well, me and him feudin'
On your life I tried to talk to him
But you know niggas, think they guns can stop four niggas
Frontin' like they're Big Willie but really owe niggas
Hoe niggas, this year I'll show niggas — think I'm slippin'?
I'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshittin'
But my hustle's goin' too well to hit him
You was right, niggas want you to be miserable with them
Anyway, I ain't tryin' to hear it, I think I'm touched
This whole verse I been talkin' to your spirit a little too much

[Chorus 1]
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets

WISH. Lyrics

[Intro]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a-
I don't give a-, I don't-
This will be an ugly motherfucker

[Verse 1]
I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D-O-T my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be cautious!"
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know

[Chorus]
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would
I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

[Verse 2]
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Fuck subliminals, I put you on that roll-call
French Montana speakin' on me in interviews
Very cynical, dry hatin' somethin' I don't approve
Jay Electronica threw silences on my GRAMMY night
Another dead prophet hopin' that God will give him life
Big Sean, you sneak dissin', I'll let it slide
I think his false confidence got him inspired
I can't make them respect you baby, it's not my job
You finally famous for who you date, not how you rhyme (Boy)
Cute ass raps, get your puberty up
Then make you a classic album before you come at us
Drake and Meek Mill beef might got you gassed up
But I'm a whole 'nother beast, I'd really fuck you up

[Chorus]
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would
I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

[Verse 3]
This goes out for those who choose to use disrespectful views on the king of hip-hop
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now you brailin' it, fuck that light shit, I'm scalin' it
Niggas thought they wouldn't gon' see me, huh?
Niggas thought K-Dot real life is the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas think they can flex on me and still live in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time you hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealously get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
That passive aggressive shit only work for your fans
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all on top, but none of y'all top five
Most of y'all know I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween a black artist and wack artist (Woo)

[Skit]
You're my sons, go to your room, go to your room!

[Outro]
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would
I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

Hot 97 Interview on “Control” Lyrics
Kendrick’s guest verse on Big Sean’s “Control” flipped the hip-hop world on it’s head. He finally addressed the impact of his words on Hot 97’s morning radio show.
Excerpts via The Fader
On the response to the line "I’m the king of New York":
It made me go back here and feel like I probably gotta dumb down my lyrics nowadays, for people to take it way out of context the way they did…
The main heads that really understood the context of the line was the actual kings of New York, the cats that I sat down with this past week.
They’re not understanding that it’s not about the culture, it’s not about what side we on, it’s about being great as Biggie, as Pac, the two cats that I referenced…
I feel like I’m a student.
I’m a student of the work that they did. When I put down 20 years in the game, I can eventually plant my foot and have that same type of legacy… I never take the history behind what Pac laid or what BIG laid.
On Kendrick’s king of rap, Snoop Dogg:
To keep it 100 with you,
Snoop will always be number one, and I’m from the West Coast, and he gave me that.
But out of respect for my big homie, I understand it. He laid down. I only got one album out homie. One album out. I got years to be doing this. At the end of the day, Snoop will always be my big homie and the legends that came before me they will always stand tall where they’re at. But I can’t stop myself from wanting to be great just like them.
On East/West rivalry in 2013:
I feel as though you have certain cats that are really gonna take it to the next level and make it a rivalry thing and try to bring back that whole thing. No that’s old school homie. We black men out here trying to uplift the culture.
My first sold out show was in New York
…I respect the legends in the game. I respect people that done it before me, people that lost their lives over this. Because of what they laid down, I’m gonna try to go ten times harder and breathe it and live it. That’s the point of the whole verse, what I was trying to convey through that verse. All the ignorance behind it, you can kill that noise. It’ll never be like that again, two coast rivalry. Not on my behalf.

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her Black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read, "No apologies"
The other said, "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's something that the pastor don't preach
That's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money, we can't keep
But we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild

I Am Somebody Lyrics

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was younger, mama had said one day I'll be a star
Handful of singers, one of these dollars gon' add up tomorrow
Cadillac Brougham, pull up slowly, whistlin' El DeBarge
Tap on my shoulder, he said whatever I do, better do it with heart

[Chorus]
I am somebody,

[Verse 3]
Facin' four finger rings
Drug dealin' and bitches both in s-ini-ync
You only wanted to be king
Ten million in cash was an extreme
Chastised me 'till I got it right, ah
I was shy but I always wanted your advice
Summoned your ghost when I felt weak, ah
That's the transfered energy of a black sheep
Hey, when I was younger, mama once said one day I'll be a star
Maybe brighter than tomorrow, I fly if I ever fall
See the water in my E-Y-E, huh
Steppin' on steppers was the POV, huh
Who would I be if I ain't used my voice? Tuh
I am the flowerchild of D-O-C, ah
I am the savant of the hallway watchers
I am the confessions of all my chakras
Lift up my hands to the heavens and pull
Back to my God, that's a heavy renewal
Remember when I wanted to be like you
Two Gemini's both living out our truth
I find it funny we nothing alike
But I still call your name in light of the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was younger, mama had said one day I'll be a star
Handful of singers, one of these dollars gon' add up tomorrow
Cadillac Brougham, pull up slowly, whistlin' El DeBarge
Tap on my shoulder, he said whatever I do better do it with heart

I am somebody, I am
I am somebody, I am (I am)

[Verse 1; Jay-Z & Beyonce ]
Gyeah, yeah
Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we gotta be her,e life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
Went from having shabby clothes to crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me ( "Are you happy, Hov?" )
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing like
Colleek, are you praying for me?
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father, so I barter my tomorrows
Against my yesterdays
,
in hopes that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here, to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter
and a new beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Every day, hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space in this world of fly girls
Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes, I twirls
Benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
Son said, "Hov, how you get so fly?"
I said, "From not being afraid to fall out the sky"
My physical's a shell, so when I say farewell
My soul will find a even higher plane to dwell
So fly, you shall, so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z ]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream
Can't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the Winners' Cup
With winters rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner – nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes with this life, just eyes
So to map it out, you must look inside
Sure, books could guide you, but your heart defines you, chica
Your corazón is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, maricón
I am on permanent vacay,
life is but a beach chair
This song's like a Hallmark card, until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes;
and so you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you, to think, I ink these verses full of prose
So you won't get conned out of two cent
My last will and testament – "I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair"

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z ]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

I hear my angels sing
I hear my angels sing
I hear my angels sing

Thank You Lyrics
Sampling “Ele e Ela” by Marcos Valle, Kanye and No I.D. come together again to provide a backdrop for Jay’s tongue-in-cheek “acceptance” speech.
It’s an upmarket take on classic Jay Z braggadacio.

[Intro]
Thank you, thank you very much for coming out this evening

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines

[Verse 1]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, please hold your applause
For I just applied logic—keys, keys open doors
Now I'm balcony, opera, black tux, binocular
Black Luxe, stop it, I shouldn't be so popular
Name keep poppin' up, face keep poppin' up
On the tube, I'm just watchin' Pacquiao box 'em up
How would I know HBO would get a shot of us?
Sittin' so close that we almost got snot on us
Please don't bow in my presence—how am I a legend?
I just got ten #1 albums, maybe now eleven?
More hits than a
Now 11
; that is no reason
To treat me like I'm somehow from outta Heaven
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes
Thank God, what a guy, as I say my grace!
Who woulda thought by makin' birds migrate for the winter
I be fly all summer? Might I say

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Verse 2]
Hovi baby, we are really high, really high tonight
We tip the waiter a hundred dollars to keep the ice cold, alright?
We the last ones to keep the wise guys code alive
If I can't live by my word, then I'd much rather die
No, no, don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched
I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits
For
The Color of Money
like a Tom Cruise flick
'Cept I put eight balls in corners without usin' pool sticks
Beautiful music when champagne flutes click, eh
Beautiful women sippin' through rouge lips, eh
Danger approaches, we're like, "Wait – who's this?"
Let us save you some trouble, son, what size suit you is?
This way after the Ruger shoots through a few clips
You can lay in your casket just as you is
We appreciate the target practices
We'll be sure to send flower baskets, kid

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Verse 3]
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
I was gon' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales
I was gon' 9/11 'em,
but they didn't need the help
And they did a good job, them boys is talented as hell
'Cause not only did they brick, they put a building up as well
Then ran a plane into that building, and when that building fell
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar, then took a smell
'Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills
Niggas thought they was ill, found out they was
ill
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Outro]
We are really high, really really high, no
Really really high, really high tonight, ha
We are really high, really high tonight
We are really high, really high tonight
Lucky Lefty

kiss the wife goodnight for me, hehe

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter
wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes, you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy a sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now, let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome: me, you, and a blunt
I love your titties 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit, make-believe, rappin' 'bout my own life
Real names, kill things, that's that shit I won't write
'Cause my niggas still sellin' dope like they ain't on their third strikes
Campin' out in that corridor

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They wanna find me not breathin' like they found Mike
(Woah-oh-oh) A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
(Woah-oh-oh) But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
(Ayy!)
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife' (Ayy!)
In that pussy so deep, I could have drowned twice
(Woah-oh-oh) Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
(Woah-oh-oh) Eatin' good; vegetarian with the brown rice
(Ayy!)
Girls kissin' girls, 'cause it's hot, right? (Ayy!)
But unless they use a strap-on, then they not dykes
(Woah-oh-oh) They ain't about that life
They ain't about that life
(Woah-oh-oh) We hangin' out the window
It's 'bout to be a Suge night
(Ayy!)
Free Bump J, real nigga for life

Screamin', "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!" (Sosa)
I don't want relations, I just want one night (One night)
'Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like (Nah)
I got tats up on my arm 'cause this shit is life (That's life. Tatted)
And I stunt so much in clothes 'cause I'm livin' life (Life, Louis, Gucci)

Nigga, I'm fuckin' insane, fuck is you sayin'?
Yo' ass been doin' the same
Shit, not doin' what you sayin', dang

Turn one hoe to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holdin' that pain
I just hope you been prayin'—bang, bang!
Ridin' for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Goin' hard the whole night 'cause I ain't goin' back to my old life, I promise

[Chorus: Chief Keef & Jadakiss ]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, nah)

She blowin' up my phone; that's that bitch I don't like, nah
Jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother thirty for the Jesus (Uh-huh)

For the Girlfriends Lyrics
Abazaba
You know we get in the studio and do what we do best
You know
Beautiful shit
But this time around I wanna do something different homeboy
You feel me my nig
Hop on them keys real quick my nig

I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight

Yea hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend'll like
(Verse 1: Kendrick)
Check me out
She say she love it when it sounds like this
She tell me Kendrick put it down like this
When I listen I wanna close my eyes
And feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap around me and grab my hips
So enticing
On point like the helmet of a Viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I could get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice
Or she could take the panties off and I could eat the (PIE PIE)
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune
You know why?
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm Playing shit my girlfriend'll like
Hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Aba
,
this shit my girlfriend'll like my nigga
Look
(Verse 2: Kendrick)
We be in the car, bumpin' my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 p.m
It's a club banger
Catchy hooks and 808's
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first 8 bars, she's lovin' the track
Even rewinding it back
Soon as the beat drop
The way she react she like "That's Hot"
'Til I start talkin' bout how many hoes I got
How many I fucked
How many I've misled just to get a nut
Like a squirrel, in pursuit of lunch
Uh
Though I'm on some cliché rapper shit
I know she thinking are my lyrics that accurate
She's so cool doe
Don't downplay her just to fuck up the mood yo
She'll still play it even though I sound rude yo
And disregards to the provocative records
One thing that I do know
This something my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend'll like
Told you that my girlfriend'll like
Other hoes tonight
Soul
(Verse 3: Ab-Soul)
This something my girlfriend'll like too
Kendrick I got you
This a great idea
This'll be my girlfriend's joint right here
So I'mma kick the shit she like
It seem right
Like a pair of jeans that fit tight
Around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
At the movies
Her body language gets read
Like a ruby
Cause she a work-a-art
No help from Julie
I'mma beast and she such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from an arc, but best undercover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
Like a iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me
I mean me and her
I mean her and I
It's plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me
You know where Herbert is
On her mind
Like she on mine
Uh
Play some shit my girlfriend'll like
Cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
She do music too, this shit my girlfriend'll write
If she was me talking bout her
DJ
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I wrote some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Now I'm sho' to get some cuddy

[Intro: Kanye West & Chaka Khan ]
( Through the test of time )
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan ]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye To The…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody order pancakes, I'll just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-izz-O’s back to w-izz-ork
How do you console my mom, or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she
been
throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I've been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire; ha–I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make Da Band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
I really apologize to everyone right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said, like, six weeks
Y'know, he had–I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror–half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds,
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt,
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank
God
I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to
God
, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe–safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in
Vanilla Sky
,
it was televised
"There's been an accident," like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable
, what you thought, they call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
(Uh-huh)
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid 

[shit] that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
(Uh-huh! Yeah!)
Make music that's fire,
spit my soul through the wire
(Woo!)

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had to, um...
I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin...
I said, "Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"
She can't be serious, man

[Outro: Chaka Khan]
–to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire...

Overthink / Tranquilizer Lyrics
[ Part I]

[Verse 1]
What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killing her
What is a relative making repetitive narratives
On how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents' evil thirst
What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity
I went and got me a therapist
I can debatе on my theories and sharing it (Woah)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up bеcause time was imperative (Woah)
Started to feel like it's only one answer
To everything, I don't know where it is (Woah)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (Woah)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Woah)
Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?
I'm flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself and my life and my music
The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing
The demons portrayed as religionous
I wake in the morning, another appointment
I hope the psychologist listenin'

[Part II]

[Interlude]
Sometimes I gotta vent, I don't have no one to talk to
Gotta put my pride aside just to call you
These piano keys, they study me well
Kids, listen up, I got some stories to tell

[Verse 2]
This bitch said my woman not black, uh
Because she light skinned with her head down her back, uh
See, growing up, none of us niggas cared about that, uh
We all off the Top Ramen
We all in apartments looking at Martin on broke recliners (I know she know)
I say, "What's your feelings on that?", she say, "Fuck them hoes"
She say it's sad to see black women act different to other black women
Clashing and color ad-libbing to fuck over each other
When half of our mothers' conditions did the dirty work for us
"So what’s the dirty work?", she said, "Nigga, we insecure
From a grown man’s insecurity
Lack of profession, lack of maturity
Manipulation like sex the only reason for you and me
We tolerate this
Your perception of bad bitches make us hate the next bitch
So I ain't mad when they be mad, and speaking on me
Take a jab, because I got heart and I look the part with a lookin' ass"
I understand it's deeper than colorism
I said, "What about the ones that pray?", she said, "Fuck them bitches"
"'Cause they be praying on your downfall, wannabe feminists, turn into serpents around y'all"
Maybe I'm sensitive, maybe observant, maybe I'm flawed, maybe been through too much
Living life in the ghetto as a woman kept us in cuffs
Cause the light-skins get picked on, the dark-skins don't get picked
Whoever choose sides need to die so we can exist

[Chorus]
Some of you niggas need tranquilizer
Some of you bitches need tranquilizer
Some of you crackers need tranquilizer
And I vow to put you all down
You got me fucked up
And I vow to put you all down

[Verse 3]
I seen the liars, I seen the opportunists, I seen the tired
I seen my own flesh and blood try to sue me
I seen it coming, this day made desires
I give and give 'till I can't give no more
Then forget to forgive once I don't feel no more
Who took advantage of you?
How foul do you gotta play to get a W?
They'll smile in your mother's face, then try and hustle you
Wish I can make this all up, I cannot share enough of me
It was them versus us (Us), had to swap out my company
No more, you fuck with me
Maybe I'm too sensitive, forever live would be trill
Especially when my intentions is to set sail
The family fortune further would go, but that's a fantasy
I'm fortunate, 'cause now I know

[Chorus]
Some of you niggas need tranquilizer
Some of you bitches need tranquilizer
Some of you crackers need tranquilizer
And I vow to put you all down
You got me fucked up
And I vow to put you all down

[Outro]
Sometimes I vent
She said, "Whatever you feel right now, just vent"
He said, "However you feel right now, just..."
She said, "Whatever you feel right now, just vent"
And I vow to put you all down
<|song_end|>
<|song_start|>
[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes, I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes, I scare, myself, myself

[Verse 1]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
Is he gon' make it? TBD, huh
Thought I was gon' run, DMC, huh
I done died and lived again on DMT, huh
See, this a type of high that won't come down
This the type of high that get you gunned down
Yeezy, Yeezy trollin' OD, huh

Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too
I'ma pray for him 'cause he got MeToo'd
Thinkin' what if that happened to me too
Then I'm on E! News

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes, I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes, I scare myself, myself

[Verse 2]
Ayy, hospital bed a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
I hear y'all bringin' my name up a lot
Guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked, but I'm really not
You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it, that's a 50 pop
I still bring the bad bitches in the city out
Uh, just a different type of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa, uh
Told my wife I've never seen her
After I hit it, bye, Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it up

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See, this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye!
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout!
Sometimes, I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds, ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, "Look, you had a shot at Ye?"
Sometimes, I scare myself, myself
You'd drop everything!

[Verse 3]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Smash, she gon' end up on TV, huh
Last thing that you ever wanna see, huh
I can feel the spirits all around me
I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me
They know I got demons all on me
Devil been tryna make an army
They been strategizin' to harm me
They don't know they dealin' with a zombie
Niggas been tryna test my Gandhi
Just because I'm dressed like Abercrombie

[Outro]
You see? You see?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
That's why I fuck with Ye!
See, that's my third per—
That's my bipolar shit, nigga, what?
That's my superpower, nigga, ain't no disability
I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!
Agh!

[Verse 1: Quavo]

Lifestyle on camera (Camera)
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier (Chandelier)
They tried to turn me to an animal (Animal)
But white people think I'm radical (Radical)
Supermodels think I'm handsome (Handsome)
You might think I'm too aggressive (Aggressive)
But really I think I'm too passive (Hey)
'Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin' (Bow)

Pray for me
I'm about to hit the Ye button
I don't wanna say nothin' wrong
But it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'
Imagine if I ain't say somethin'
Wouldn't none these niggas say nothin'
I done lost and made money
Now I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me
And I'm fresh out of debt in this mothafucka!
And they still ain't ready yet for a muhfucka!
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on
I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
Fresh out the feds in this mothafucka (Hah)
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka (No)
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on (Huh?)
Now that Gucci home, it's over for you Gucci clones

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Big Sean ]
1500, all in singles (Straight up)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go ( Straight up )

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Look, I say a prayer for my enemies (Prayer)
They cannot slow down what's meant for me
Funny how they come around like I can't see through they secret identities
Lately, it's all about Zen in me
Subtractin' the negative energy
Fuck with the family, turn your ass to a memory
My niggas keep it a century
I blow the check up, nigga, detonation
Kill 'em one by one,
Final Destination
Top my destination
I got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's deflectin' Satan
I'm a mothafuckin' champion
This right here the fuckin' anthem
I can't dap you without hand san'
I don't know where your dirty ass hands been
I wake up to like a hundred texts
Championship team, but we can't cut the net (Okay)
She all off in my jersey lookin' underdressed
I'm finna buy this bitch a Honda CRX
With...

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner ]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

[Verse 5: 2 Chainz]
I took a nap in the pulpit
I never like how a suit fit
I got a pocket full of money
It got me walkin' all slew-foot
I'm on my wave like a cruise ship
In that ho mouth like a toothpick
Anyone get in my way
Nothin' to say, I tote 'em choppas like pool sticks
I wear pajamas to Ruth's Chris
Couldn't walk a mile in my new kicks
I'm comin' from the apartments
We never had our damn pool fixed
Walk in the mall with my new bitch
Tell her to get the whole rack
My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch
Then pull me a new bitch
See that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my neck
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck
I got a mansion full of marble floors
It look like I could go bowl in this bitch
Versace logos on bowls in this bitch
Like I'm a serial killer
I put the real in gorilla
I did this shit for my niggas

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner ]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti!
Reach for my chain is suicide
The car I drive fit two inside
They mad at Ye 'cause he all in the neighborhood
But he let them goons inside
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Buy every house in this bitch
You know that the money good
My wrist in the kitchen go 'round and 'round
Play with the kid, I'ma gun you down
The roof on that Wraith in the lost and found
Official trap shit let me slow it down
Way more shit than a Pamper
All we rock is bandanas
Whips so nasty, no manners
I just got head in a Phantom

[Verse 7: Gucci Mane]
She say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ
She say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp (Gucci!)
1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp
And he don't never sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp
I heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn
My bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am
I love my Auntie Jane, but fuck Uncle Sam
I'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram
Niggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram
My city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown
And I don't really fuck around
I gave my bitch two mil' 'cause she stuck around

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner ]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

Versus (Interlude) Lyrics
“Versus” is a quick eight-bar sonning from Hov.

[Verse 1]
Hey, sucka nigga, wherever you are
I thought about you, fool, while I was driving my car
I wonder if you fools realize how far you are
You're nowhere in my rear mirror

[Verse 2]
Your last shit ain't better than my first shit, uh
Your best shit ain't better than my worst shit, uh
The truth in my verses versus
Your metaphors about what your net worth is

[Outro]
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Yeah, uh
Vacay the pain away, uh
Smoking the pain away, uh
Drinking the–uh

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Look at all we been through since last August
Skating through the rumors like, "Aw, shit!"
Still came back, fucked up the red carpet
Shows how big your heart is
On the Run, we took a hundred together
More than the money, it was the fact that we done it together
Uh, healing in real time
Song Cry
to
Resentment
, that was real crying
Bonnie and Clyde things, we hold it down
Had we surrendered then, that'd be the real crime
Got through it, got blessed times two with it
New Bel-Air estates with four pools in it
I told my bro, "You gotta go home," over vino
Goodfella, don't gamble with your life, this ain't Casino
Cost him two mill' plus the child support
We'll get the money back, but not the child support
It's getting too late, we can't afford mistakes
Woulda broke me down had you got away
It woulda broke me up, you took my child away
I'm glad we found a way
Sexin' the pain away
Vacay the pain away
Drinking the pain away
Smoking the pain away

[Verse 2: James Blake & JAY-Z ]
Too perfect not to wonder ( yeah )
If we created a flame that would warm us 'til it’s over
We invented lovers from company for the summer
I was many faces, but at least I was willing to change
I was worried that the way I was would end me up alone
Shit feels so beautiful, don't you agr
ee?
I was worried that the way I was would end me up alone

[Beat Change]

[Interlude: JAY-Z]
Our external reality is an opportunity to heal our internal upset
Let's build a cathedral these evils couldn't fuck with
I wanna spend my Saturdays and my latter-days
Eating sundaes
and enjoying Mondays
Not worrying about what none say

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Yoncé, all on this mouth like liquor
Uh, that my nigga, uh, that my nigga
Over everything, each of our mood swings
Whenever attitudes change, like a mood ring
Ain't nothing like somebody that get ya, baby, I get ya
Let's go through this thing, come out stronger, the golden journey
Broken is better than new, that's kintsukuroi
You're fine china, I'm a bull and ball in a china shop
I promise to repair with gold each bowl I drop
Be grateful for whatever comes because each has been sent
From a guy from beyond, that's what Rumi say
"Never go to bed mad," that's what my Ummi say
It always took her less to say more
I always thought she was an angel, now I'm sure, sure

[Intro: Beyoncé]
Deliver me from my enemies, o' God
Defend me from all that rise up against me
Deliver me from the work of iniquity
And save me from the Bloody Men

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Look, mind state of a gangster from the '40s
Meets the business mind of Motown's Berry Gordy
Turned crack rock into a chain of '40/40's
Sorry, my jewelry's so gaudy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauri's
America, meet the gangster Shawn Corey
"Hey, Young World," wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes and you can pretend you're me
I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedy's
Frank Sinatra, having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed Black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence
As the incense burn
And the turntables turn and that Al Green plays
I see my mother's afro
As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's
And my papa just left the house
In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm her nerves
As I observe, this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store, we can never be sure
So all we can do is pray

[Break: Beyoncé]
Because of your strength
While I walked upon thee
For God is my defense
Pray for me!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
As I head to my homeroom
I observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground
I hear a car go, "Vroom"
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle
I ask, "Why you laugh?" They say, "You're too little"
"One day, you'll understand when you become a man
About things you have to get you"
Fast-forward, freeze-frame on my pistol
Fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
Around here, it's the shit that you just do
I just left school
The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had their guns drawn, screaming, "Just move!" ("Don't move!")
"Or is there something else you suggest we can do?"
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like, "Huh?"
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt, he calls paying dues
Now, when the rules is blurred—
As they is and were—what am I to do, but pray?
Pray the Lord forgive me
Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through
Pray

[Break: Beyoncé]
Deliver me in thy righteousness
And cause me to escape
And climb thine air unto me
Save me, thine Lord
Pray for me!

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Geah...
Anywhere there's oppression
The drug profession flourishes like beverages, refreshing
Ahh! Sweet taste of sin
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg
What came first? Moving chickens or the egg?
This is why I be so fresh
I'm tryna beat life, 'cause I can't cheat death
Treat shame with shamelessness
Aim stainlesses at anuses
You know the game this is?
Move coke like Pepsi,
don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
I'm not an angel, I'm sure
But every night before I lay, I drop my knees to the floor
And I pray

[Outro: Beyoncé]
The name shall endure forever
The name shall be continued as long as the sun
Pray for me!
Men shall be blessed in Him
All nations shall call Him blessed
In Your name, I pray
Pray for me!
Lord bless us

[Intro: Rihanna & Kanye West ]
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Woo, woo
Swizz told me let the beat rock
(Oh)
Oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz ]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous ( Goddamn )
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets, give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous ( Goddamn )
They mad they still nameless ( Talk that talk, man )
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous ( Goddamn )
Yeah, we still hood famous

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz ]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz ]
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month, I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive,
whoo!
We never gonna die,
whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes,
whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe,
whoo!
No matter how hard they try,
whoo!
We never gonna die

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz ]
I just wanted you to know
Get 'em!
