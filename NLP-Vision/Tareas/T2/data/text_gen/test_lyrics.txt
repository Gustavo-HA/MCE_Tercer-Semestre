[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] How much a dollar really cost? The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo "20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo Twenty years ago, can't forget Now I can lend him a ear or two How to stack these residuals tenfold The liberal concept of what men'll do "20 on 6," he didn't hear me Indigenous African only spoke Zulu My American tongue was leery Walked out the gas station A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion Asked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' He begged and pleaded Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it Told him, "Beat it" Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated Listen to me, I want a single bill from you Nothin' less, nothin' more" I told him I ain't have it and closed my door Tell me, how much a dollar cost? [Chorus: James Fauntleroy] It's more to feed your mind Water, sun and love, the one you love All you need, the air you breathe [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] He's starin' at me in disbelief My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see The reason why he was mad at a stranger Like I was supposed to save him Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck I never understood someone beggin' for goods Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could And this particular person just had it down pat Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked "Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? A humble man is all that we ever need" Tell me, how much a dollar cost? [Chorus: James Fauntleroy] It's more to feed your mind Water, sun and love, the one you love All you need, the air you breathe [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment I never met a transient that demanded attention They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin Moonshine and gin, nigga, you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin' I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God" [Outro: Ronald Isley] I washed my hands, I said my grace What more do you want from me? Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be Shades of grey will never change if I condone Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs [Produced by LoveDragon]

[Part I: "Sing About Me"] [Chorus] When the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me [Verse 1] I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you In case I'm not here tomorrow I'm hopin' that I can borrow A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important My mind is really distorted I find nothing but trouble in my life I'm fortunate you believe in a dream This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine And last night was just another distraction Or a reaction of what we consider madness I know exactly what happened You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up But the type of bullet that stuck Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands My plan's rather vindictive Everybody's a victim in my eyes When I ride it's a murderous rhythm And outside became pitch black A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em!" I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck That same mentality I told my brother not to duck In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover The life that I knew as a youngin In pajamas and dun-ta-duns When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb Niggas like me never prosper Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted This Piru shit been in me forever So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [ Gunshots ] [Chorus] Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me [Verse 2] You wrote a song about my sister on your tape And called it Section.80 The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby" What's crazy was I was hearin' about it But doubted your ignorance How could you ever just put her on blast and shit? Judgin' her past and shit? Well, it's completely my future Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit And I'ma need that forty dollars Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed By a married man, and father of three My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week This is the life of another girl damaged by the system These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim Of a family gene that show women how to be woman Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin' Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song 'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin' I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin' You lyin' to these motherfuckers Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, bullshit And when I die... [Chorus] When the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me [Verse 3] Sometimes I look in the mirror And ask myself am I really scared of passin' away? If it's today, I hope I hear a Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin' The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons I suffer a lot And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch I tie my stomach in knots And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest And you're right, your brother was a brother to me And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me In a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told" Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin' Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's I count lives, all on these songs Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in? [Chorus] Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me [Outro] Promise that you'll sing about me forever Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh Promise that you'll sing about me forever Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh Promise that you'll sing about me forever Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh Promise that you'll sing about me forever Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh [Part II: "I'm Dying of Thirst"] [Skit] (On the phone) "Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?"
