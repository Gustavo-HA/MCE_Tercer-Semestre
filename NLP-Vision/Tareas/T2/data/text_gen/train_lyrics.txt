[Verse 1: JAY-Z] Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling) Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it? See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin' What I do through and through and I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters From botched robberies, niggas crouched over Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over Knocked down by some clown When child support knocked, "No, he's not around" Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways Just read a magazine that fucked up my day How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it? I help them see they way through it, not you Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt [Verse 2: Eminem] Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute 'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics? Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits? But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment? Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha) And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here? I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo 'Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a [Chorus: Eminem & JAY-Z ] Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to talk about anything ( Anything? ), anything ( Anything ) Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to holler about anything (Anything?), anything (Anything) [Verse 3: JAY-Z] I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope Do not step to me I'm awkward, I box lefty An orphan, my pops left me And often my mama wasn't home Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown 'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings My demeanor thirty years my senior My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up Raisin' my fingers to critics , raisin' my head to the sky Big, I did it, multi before I die No lie, just know I chose my own fate I drove by the fork in the road and went straight [Verse 4: Eminem] See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape? Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' "Dixie" While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you What did I do? (Huh?), I'm just a kid from the gutter Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin' [Chorus: Eminem & JAY-Z ] Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to talk about anything ( Anything? ), anything ( Anything ) Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to holler about anything (Anything?), anything (Anything) Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to talk about anything ( Anything? ), anything ( Anything ) Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to holler about anything (Anything?), anything (Anything)

[Intro] Uh (Uh) Uh (Uh) Uh, yeah (Uh) It's survival, survival I think somebody lying Smell somebody lying I don't see no fire [Verse 1] Off-white Sunseeker at the marina Fuck a Phantom, I like to buy yachts when I get the fever Wine cooler spill on my white t-shirt, the sightseer Trifecta, money, morals, and culture, that's my leisure My visa, passport tatted, I show up in Ibiza Lucalis dwellings in Brooklyn just to book me some pizza Who could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom God, ah, my confession is yours But, who am I if I don't go to war? There's opportunity when livin' with loss I discover myself when I fall short Raise my hands to a fallen sky, I fantasize Me jumpin' planets immortalized, I correspond Three angels watchin' me all the time Put my children to sleep with a prayer, then close my eyes Definition of peace Tell me who gon' stop me? I come from love Estelle cover my heart, then open me up Remember when picked up a pen, lyrics that I can trust Timid soul, stare in the mirror, askin' where I was from often I know this type of power is gon' cost But I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star The mannerisms of Raphael, I can heal and give you art But the industry's cooked as I pick the carcass apart [Verse 2] Yeah, somebody's lyin', I can see the vibes on Ak' Even he lookin' compromised, let's peel the layers back Ain't no brownie points for beating your chest, harassin' Ant Fuckin' with good people make good people go to bat Conspiracies about Cash, dog? That's not even the leak Find the jewels like Kash Doll, I just need you to think Are you finally ready to play have-you-ever? Let's see Have you ever thought that OVO is workin' for me? Fake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it Can't Toosie Slide up outta this one, it's just gon' resurface Every dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose It was fun until you started to put money in the streets Then lost money 'cause they came back with no receipts I'm sorry that I live a boring life, I love peace But war-ready if the world is ready to see you bleed The Elohim, KTW, know you can't sleep, these images trouble you Know the wires in your circle should puzzle you If you were street-smart, then you woulda caught that your entourage is only to hustle you A hundred niggas that you got on salary And twenty of 'em want you as a casualty And one of them is actually next to you And two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle Just don't got the audacity to tell you But let me tell you some game 'cause I can see you, my lil' homie You playin' dirty with propaganda, it blow up on ya You're playin' nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots But your reality can't hide behind Wi-Fi Your lil' memes is losin' steam, they figured you out The forced opinions is not convincin', y'all need a new route It's time that you look around on who's around you Before you figure that you're not alone, ask: "What Mike would do?"

When shit hit the fan— (One, two, one, two, one, two) Uh, when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? Could I let you down easily? Is your heart where it need to be? Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar? Or question my character and degrade me on every blog? Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question: [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar] When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

How much you believe in her? You think she gon' stick around if them twenty-five years occur? You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt? You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired? Even though y'all share the same blood, is it worth the time? Like, who got your best interest? Like, how much are you dependent? How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending? How tough is your skin when they turn you in? Do you show forgiveness? What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended? What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing? What kind of bridge did they burn? Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom You wanna be remembered that delivered the message That considered the blessing of everyone This your lesson for everyone, say: [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar] When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin' Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression And if you riding with me, nigga— [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you That's not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson I went to Robben's Island analysing; that's where his cell is So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me? Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be? See, I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy's Law Generation X—will I ever be your ex? Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y'all It's respect, but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall How many leaders you said you needed, then left 'em for dead? Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it's Michael Jackson—oh [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar] When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? That nigga gave us "Billie Jean," you say he touched those kids? When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga [ Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac ] "I remember you was conflicted Misusing your influence Sometimes I did the same Abusin' my power, full of resentment Resentment that turned into a deep depression Found myself screamin' in the hotel room I didn't wanna self-destruct The evils of Lucy was all around me So I went runnin' for answers Until I came home But that didn't stop survivor's guilt Goin' back and forth tryin' to convince myself the stripes I earned Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was But while my loved ones was fightin' the continuous war back in the city I was entering a new one A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned The word was 'respect' Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us But I don't know, I'm no mortal man Maybe I'm just another nigga" Shit, and that's all I wrote I was gonna call it "Another Nigga," but it ain't really a poem I just felt like it's somethin' you probably could relate to Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa—, about a metaphor, actually Uh, you spoke on the ground What you mean by that? What the ground represent? The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil (Right) That's how I see it, my word is bond I see—, and the ground is the symbol for the poor people (Right) The poor people is gonna open up this whole world And swallow up the rich people 'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat (Mhm) And they gonna be so appetizing (Mhm) You know what I'm sayin'? Wealthy (Right), appetizing The poor gonna be so poor (Hungry), and hungry Right You know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be like— You know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be— There might—, there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu—, they might eat the rich, you know what I'm sayin'? A'ight, so let me ask you this, then Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich, or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities? I see myself as a natural-born hustler A true hustler in every sense of the word I took nothin', I took the opportunities I worked at the m—, the most menial and degradin' job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it Uh, I went from havin' somebody managin' me to me hirin' the person that works my management company (Right) I changed everything, I realized my destiny in a matter of five years, you know what I'm sayin'? I made myself a millionaire (Right), I made—, I made millions for a lot of people Now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying? I made millions for the record companies (Mhm) I made millions for these movie companies (Mhm) Now I make millions for, for us (Mm) And through your different avenues of success How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? By my faith in God, by my faith in the game And by my faith in "all go—, all good things come to those that stay true" (Right) You know what I'm sayin'? And it was happenin' to me for a reason You know what I'm sayin'? I was noticin'—, shit I was punchin' the right buttons and it was happenin' So, it's no problem, you know I mean, it's a problem, but I'm not finna let them know (Hmm) I'm finna go straight through Would you consider yourself a—, a fighter at heart, or somebody that, huh, somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh, threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance And not only me, but it goes down my family tree You know what I'm sayin'? it's in my veins to fight back A'ight, well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like "We fightin' a war—, I'm fightin' a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down"? In this country, a Black man only have like Five years we can exhibit maximum strength And that's right now, while you a teenager, while you still strong While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back 'Cause once you turn thirty, it's like They take the heart and soul out of a man Out of a Black man in this country And you don't wanna fight no more And if you don't believe me, you can look around You don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers (Mhm) That's crazy, because me, being one of your offsprings of—, of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that there's nothin' but turmoil goin' on, so I want to ask you, what you think is the future for me and my generation today? I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed, for real I don't think America know that I think America think we was just playin' and it's gonna be some more playin', but it ain't gonna be no playin' It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831 (Mhm), up in this motherfucker You know what I'm sayin'? It's go—, it's gonna happen (Mm) That's crazy, man In my opinion, the only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations A lot of people don't understand how important it is, you know Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out, or where it comes from Trip me out sometimes Because it's spirits We ain't even really rappin', we just lettin' our dead homies tell stories for us (Damn) I wanted to read one last thing to you It's actually something a good friend had wrote, describing my world It says: "The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it In order to protect itself from this mad city While consumin' its environment, the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar But having a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits Already surrounded by this mad city, the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him He can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as going home, and bringin' back new concepts to this mad city The result? Wings begin to emerge, breakin' the cycle of feelin' stagnant Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered Endin' the internal struggle Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different They are one and the same" What's your perspective on that? 'Pac? 'Pac? 'Pac?

"'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low? Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?" "Well, you was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four License and registration and step out of the car Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are" I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit "Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?" Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that "Aren't you sharp as a tack? You some type of lawyer or something? Somebody important or something?" Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit Enough that you won't illegally search my shit "Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!"

[Chorus] Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

Alright, alright No church in the wild [Verse 1: JAY-Z] Tears on the mausoleum floor Blood stains the Colosseum doors Lies on the lips of a priest Thanksgiving disguised as a feast Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police Cocaine seats All white like I got the whole thing bleached Drug dealer chic I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?

[Intro: Hannah Williams] Do I find it so hard When I know in my heart I'm letting you down every day Letting you down every day Why do I keep on running away? [Verse 1: JAY-Z] Look, I apologize, often womanize Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you I harassed you out in Paris "Please come back to Rome, you make it home" We talked for hours when you were on tour "Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!" I said: "Don't embarrass me" instead of "Be mine" That was my proposal for us to go steady That was your 21st birthday You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready So I apologize I seen the innocence leave your eyes I still mourn its death and I apologize for all the stillborns 'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions 'Cause I was emotionless And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed And you stare blankly into space Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit So I apologize [Chorus: Kim Burrell] I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should Oh [Verse 2: JAY-Z] I apologize Our love was one for the ages and I contained us And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions Or sleep with our back turned We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops And then meet in a space where the dark stop And let love light the way Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face I never wanted another woman to know Something about me that you didn't know I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold I suck at love, I think I need a do-over I will be emotionally available if I invited you over I stew over; "What if—" "You over my shit?" [Chorus: Kim Burrell] I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should Oh [Verse 3: JAY-Z] And if my children knew I don't even know what I would do If they ain't look at me the same I would prob'ly die with all the shame "You did what with who?" What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? "You risked that for Blue?" If I wasn't a superhero in your face My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes And the mask goes away And Santa Claus is fake And you go online and see For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay [Chorus: Hannah Williams] I'm never gonna treat you like I should

Somebody that's holdin' my checks Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt? I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers? The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin' Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin' I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck At twenty-seven years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me What they see from me would trickle down generations in time What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride 'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap Damn [Bridge 2: Bēkon] God damn you, God damn me God damn us, God damn we God damn us all [Outro: Carl Duckworth] Verse 2 says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities" So until we come back to these commandments Until you come back to these commandments We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse Because He said He's gonna punish us The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians Are the true children of Israel We are the Israelites, according to the Bible The children of Israel He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience Because we chose to follow other gods That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised That's why we're in the position that we're in Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live Here, in today, in the United States of America I love you, family, and I pray for you God bless you Shalom
