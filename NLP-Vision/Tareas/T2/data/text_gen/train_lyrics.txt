[Intro: Hannah Williams] Do I find it so hard When I know in my heart I'm letting you down every day Letting you down every day Why do I keep on running away? [Verse 1: JAY-Z] Look, I apologize, often womanize Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you I harassed you out in Paris "Please come back to Rome, you make it home" We talked for hours when you were on tour "Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!" I said: "Don't embarrass me" instead of "Be mine" That was my proposal for us to go steady That was your 21st birthday You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready So I apologize I seen the innocence leave your eyes I still mourn its death and I apologize for all the stillborns 'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions 'Cause I was emotionless And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed And you stare blankly into space Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit So I apologize [Chorus: Kim Burrell] I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should Oh [Verse 2: JAY-Z] I apologize Our love was one for the ages and I contained us And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions Or sleep with our back turned We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops And then meet in a space where the dark stop And let love light the way Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face I never wanted another woman to know Something about me that you didn't know I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold I suck at love, I think I need a do-over I will be emotionally available if I invited you over I stew over; "What if—" "You over my shit?" [Chorus: Kim Burrell] I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should Oh [Verse 3: JAY-Z] And if my children knew I don't even know what I would do If they ain't look at me the same I would prob'ly die with all the shame "You did what with who?" What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? "You risked that for Blue?" If I wasn't a superhero in your face My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes And the mask goes away And Santa Claus is fake And you go online and see For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay [Chorus: Hannah Williams] I'm never gonna treat you like I should

[Intro] Uh (Uh) Uh (Uh) Uh, yeah (Uh) It's survival, survival I think somebody lying Smell somebody lying I don't see no fire [Verse 1] Off-white Sunseeker at the marina Fuck a Phantom, I like to buy yachts when I get the fever Wine cooler spill on my white t-shirt, the sightseer Trifecta, money, morals, and culture, that's my leisure My visa, passport tatted, I show up in Ibiza Lucalis dwellings in Brooklyn just to book me some pizza Who could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom God, ah, my confession is yours But, who am I if I don't go to war? There's opportunity when livin' with loss I discover myself when I fall short Raise my hands to a fallen sky, I fantasize Me jumpin' planets immortalized, I correspond Three angels watchin' me all the time Put my children to sleep with a prayer, then close my eyes Definition of peace Tell me who gon' stop me? I come from love Estelle cover my heart, then open me up Remember when picked up a pen, lyrics that I can trust Timid soul, stare in the mirror, askin' where I was from often I know this type of power is gon' cost But I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star The mannerisms of Raphael, I can heal and give you art But the industry's cooked as I pick the carcass apart [Verse 2] Yeah, somebody's lyin', I can see the vibes on Ak' Even he lookin' compromised, let's peel the layers back Ain't no brownie points for beating your chest, harassin' Ant Fuckin' with good people make good people go to bat Conspiracies about Cash, dog? That's not even the leak Find the jewels like Kash Doll, I just need you to think Are you finally ready to play have-you-ever? Let's see Have you ever thought that OVO is workin' for me? Fake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it Can't Toosie Slide up outta this one, it's just gon' resurface Every dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose It was fun until you started to put money in the streets Then lost money 'cause they came back with no receipts I'm sorry that I live a boring life, I love peace But war-ready if the world is ready to see you bleed The Elohim, KTW, know you can't sleep, these images trouble you Know the wires in your circle should puzzle you If you were street-smart, then you woulda caught that your entourage is only to hustle you A hundred niggas that you got on salary And twenty of 'em want you as a casualty And one of them is actually next to you And two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle Just don't got the audacity to tell you But let me tell you some game 'cause I can see you, my lil' homie You playin' dirty with propaganda, it blow up on ya You're playin' nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots But your reality can't hide behind Wi-Fi Your lil' memes is losin' steam, they figured you out The forced opinions is not convincin', y'all need a new route It's time that you look around on who's around you Before you figure that you're not alone, ask: "What Mike would do?"

What up? Nigga, you made it" So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it" So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it" Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets Making my conscience ask me "Will I survive to make it up out this hoe in time?" Black boy fly, black boy fly Black, black boy fly, black boy fly [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo He was the one to follow He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality Actually making it possible to swim His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me 'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder That we was just moving backwards The bungalow where you find us The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl Eleven graders gone wrong He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron Now watch that black boy fly [Chorus: Anna Wise] Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly Black boy [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] I used to be jealous of Jayceon I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait" Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities Chillin' my conscience next to a villain Compton made you believe success wasn't real Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal So as I peel through these lottery tickets I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block So watch that black boy fly [Chorus: Anna Wise] Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly Black boy [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted Like most of the winners call it Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan Award touring the country with money from mic recording The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40 And shortly, I got discouraged Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase That only one in a million will ever see better days Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homi' All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle? When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical? Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible So I never believed the type of performance that I could do I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton Thank God (Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly)

Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright No church in the wild [Verse 1: JAY-Z] Tears on the mausoleum floor Blood stains the Colosseum doors Lies on the lips of a priest Thanksgiving disguised as a feast Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police Cocaine seats All white like I got the whole thing bleached Drug dealer chic I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious? Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?

I wonder if they got cabs still Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard Two tattoos, one read, "No apologies" The other said, "Love is cursed by monogamy" That's something that the pastor don't preach That's something that a teacher can't teach When we die, the money, we can't keep But we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap Preach [Chorus: Frank Ocean] Human beings in a mob What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god? What's a god to a non-believer Who don't believe in anything? Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright No church in the wild [Outro: Frank Ocean] No church in the wild No church in the wild No church in the wild

[Produced by Just Blaze] [Intro: Gloria Carter] Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child. [Verse 1: JAY-Z] They say, "They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone" So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay – so long! But at least let me tell you why I'm this way – hold on I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves Who made love under the sycamore tree Which makes me a more sicker MC And my momma would claim At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain Although, through the years I gave her her fair share I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here She knows my purpose was on purpose; I ain't perfect, I care But I feel worthless, 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted Hold on [Interlude: Gloria Carter] Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is – at 4, he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up. [Verse 2: JAY-Z] Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me And my momma couldn't beat me Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me So, with that disdain in my membrane Got on my pimp game; "Fuck the world," my defense came Then DeHaven introduced me to the game Spanish José introduced me to 'caine – I'm a hustler now My gear is in, and I'm in the in-crowd And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged Plus, I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap But that came second to me movin' this crack "Gimme a second, I swear," I would say about my rap career 'Til '96 came, "niggas – I'm here"; goodbye! [Interlude: Gloria Carter] Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble. [Verse 3: JAY-Z] Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush Your blood boils, you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch No two days are alike except the 1st and 15th, pretty much And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up And the drought will define a man when the well dries up You learn the worth of water – without work, you thirst 'til you die – yup! And niggas get tied up for product And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up To show mothers they really got 'em And this was the stress I lived with 'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven For every bad decision I made, every sister I played 'Cause I'm still paranoid to this day And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me [Outro: JAY-Z] If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade...

Lock my body, can't trap my mind Easily explain why we adapt to crime I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it Presidential suites my residential for the weekend Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin' The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into? Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables Meet me by the one that starts a G up This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas [Chorus] Ge-ge-ge-yeahhh Can I live? Can I live?

[Chorus] Can I live? Can I live? Can I live? Can I live? Ha-ha, Roc-a-Fella y'all

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] How much a dollar really cost? The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo "20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo Twenty years ago, can't forget Now I can lend him a ear or two How to stack these residuals tenfold The liberal concept of what men'll do "20 on 6," he didn't hear me Indigenous African only spoke Zulu My American tongue was leery Walked out the gas station A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion Asked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' He begged and pleaded Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it Told him, "Beat it" Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated Listen to me, I want a single bill from you Nothin' less, nothin' more" I told him I ain't have it and closed my door Tell me, how much a dollar cost? [Chorus: James Fauntleroy] It's more to feed your mind Water, sun and love, the one you love All you need, the air you breathe [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] He's starin' at me in disbelief My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see The reason why he was mad at a stranger Like I was supposed to save him Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck I never understood someone beggin' for goods Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could And this particular person just had it down pat Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked "Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? A humble man is all that we ever need" Tell me, how much a dollar cost? [Chorus: James Fauntleroy] It's more to feed your mind Water, sun and love, the one you love All you need, the air you breathe [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment I never met a transient that demanded attention They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin Moonshine and gin, nigga, you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin' I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God" [Outro: Ronald Isley] I washed my hands, I said my grace What more do you want from me? Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be Shades of grey will never change if I condone Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs [Produced by LoveDragon]

A man in his feelings with bitter nerve What is a woman that really hurt? A demon, you're better off killing her What is a relative making repetitive narratives On how you did it first? That is a predator, hit reverse All of your presidents' evil thirst What is a neighborhood rep'table? That is a snitch on a pedestal What is a house with a better view? A family broken in variables What is a rapper with jewelry? A way that I show my maturity What if I call on security? That mean I'm calling on God for purity I went and got me a therapist I can debate all my theories and sharing it, woah Consolidate all my comparisons Humblin' up because time was imperative, woah Started to feel like it's only one answer To everything, I don't know where it is, woah Popping a bottle of Claritin, woah Is it my head or my arrogance? Woah Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing? I'm flipping my time through the Rolodex Indulging myself in my life and my music The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac The world that we in is just menacing The demons portrayed as religionous I wake in the morning, another appointment I hope the psychologist listenin' [Part II] [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] The new Mercedes whip, black G-Wagon The, "Where you from?" It was all for rap I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic Never had it in public, late reaction 50K to cousins, post a caption Pray none of my enemies hold me captive [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar] I grieve different I grieve different, huh [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] I met her on the third night of Chicago North America tour, my enclave Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible Eyes light green penetratin' the moonlight Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me Phone off the ringer, tell the world, "I'm busy" Fair enough, green-eyes said her mother didn't care enough Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang Her first brother got killed, he was twenty-one I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave Heartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye Chad left his body after we FaceTimed Green-eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex'd the pain away [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar] I grieve different I grieve different, huh [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] The new Mercedes whip, black G-Wagon The, "Where you from?" It was all for rap I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic Never had it in public, late reaction 50K to cousins, post a caption Pray none of my enemies hold me captive [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] So what? Paralyzed, the county building controlled us I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in I watched Keem buy four cars in four months You know the family dynamics on repeat The insecurities locked down on PC I bought a .223, nobody peace treat You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions Poverty was the case But the money wipin' the tears away [Outro: Kendrick Lamar] I grieve different (Everybody grieves different) (Everybody grieves different) I grieve different, huh

[Verse 1] I think it's time to watch the party die This shit done got too wicked to apologize It's different, get him whacked and disqualified We even kill the killers 'cause they like taking innocent lives Burn the whole village, we start over, it's really that time Why reason with these niggas if they can't see the future first? Why argue with these clowns if the circus is well at work? Just walk that man down, that'll do everyone a solid It's love, but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence If you parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose They party more than bitches, tell me, what are you working for? They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card Influencers talk down 'cause I'm not with the basic shit But they don't hate me, they hate the man that I represent The type of man that never dickride 'cause I want a favor The man that resides in patience, so where the soldiers at?

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams] Mass hallucination, baby Ill education, baby Want to reconnect with your elations? This is your station, baby [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals Of a prisoner on his way Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away I should ask a choir, "What do you require To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?" As the record spin, I should pray For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey I got ate alive yesterday I got animosity buildin', it's probably big as a buildin' Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue And you understand that I ain't but know I'm accustomed to Just a couple that look for trouble and live in the street with rank No better picture to paint than me walkin' from Bible study And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks I don't mind 'cause one day, you'll respect the good kid, m.A.A.d city [Chorus: Pharrell Williams] Mass hallucination, baby Ill education, baby Want to reconnect with your elations? This is your station, baby [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help In all honesty, I got time to be copacetic until You had finally made decision to hold me against my will It was like a head-on collision that folded me standin' still I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill Every time you clock in the mornin', I feel you just want to kill All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere As a better person—I know you heard this and probably in fear But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof And you ask, "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile I heard 'em chatter, "He's probably young, but I know that he's down Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest He don't mind, he know we'll never respect the good kid, m.A.A.d. city" [Chorus: Pharrell Williams] Mass hallucination, baby Ill education, baby Want to reconnect with your elations? This is your station, baby [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] All I see in this room—20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose The streets sure to release the worst side of my best Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city [Chorus: Pharrell Williams] Mass hallucination, baby Ill education, baby Want to reconnect with your elations? This is your station, baby

[Verse 1] I was born on February 24th, 1970 The day I was delivered, they said I would build a legacy Picture me with influence that last generations I was made out of love to keep you happy and educated The first three letters of the alphabet, my name I made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing I been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac So dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged My father was a public figure, bigger than life Lived as a winner, on stages alike Rivers of people surely united, just to see our bond Time carried on, that was a common thread My perfect father had many flaws Still they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison He had more children, I was the oldest We always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em He told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings Sexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school The price of being iconic was demonic and screwed I stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news Stress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused I knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't choose See, it was more than humiliation and bein' sued They crucified my affiliation for points to prove And now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to you My total existence was for makin' us smile and move They said that I'll live forever, but the moment he died More accusations arrived, I had to die too [Verse 2] I remember takin' my first breath August 28th, 1963 The whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV My come out was a standing ova', the crowd in disbelief How could a group of words be so great? Designed to make you think Races and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form How gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm? The person responsible, my creator He never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation Watch him perform with conviction Two hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen I gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission His life became heroic, then tables turned My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned Other women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me I prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy How many lives will fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy? I won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job I was only born to make sure your children can play outside And I imagine the other demons, he hid before he died If they came to surface, this dream probably won't be alive because of you [Verse 3] I was born in paranoia, it's poison for us We can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up The non-creators are now elated and out of touch Why can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give? Stop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived You want the head of the messenger and the history from him Which eventually takes away from the good you accustom Think of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin' The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in The great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice Why can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ? Because your better judgement will always look down on me But if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me I got a theory that most of y'all won't allow to see It goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart? If Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars? I can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a God Just know the Earth is just a rock without the voices of art, sincerely yours

[Part I: "Sing About Me"] [Chorus] When the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me [Verse 1] I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you In case I'm not here tomorrow I'm hopin' that I can borrow A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important My mind is really distorted I find nothing but trouble in my life I'm fortunate you believe in a dream This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine And last night was just another distraction Or a reaction of what we consider madness I know exactly what happened You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up But the type of bullet that stuck Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands My plan's rather vindictive Everybody's a victim in my eyes When I ride it's a murderous rhythm And outside became pitch black A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em!" I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck That same mentality I told my brother not to duck In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover The life that I knew as a youngin In pajamas and dun-ta-duns When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb Niggas like me never prosper Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted This Piru shit been in me forever So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [ Gunshots ] [Chorus] Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me [Verse 2] You wrote a song about my sister on your tape And called it Section.80 The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby" What's crazy was I was hearin' about it But doubted your ignorance How could you ever just put her on blast and shit? Judgin' her past and shit? Well, it's completely my future Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit And I'ma need that forty dollars Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed By a married man, and father of three My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week This is the life of another girl damaged by the system These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim Of a family gene that show women how to be woman Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin' Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song 'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin' I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin' You lyin' to these motherfuckers Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, bullshit And when I die... [Chorus] When the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me [Verse 3] Sometimes I look in the mirror And ask myself am I really scared of passin' away? If it's today, I hope I hear a Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin' The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons I suffer a lot And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch I tie my stomach in knots And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest And you're right, your brother was a brother to me And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me In a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told" Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin' Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's I count lives, all on these songs Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in? [Chorus] Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn To settle down, my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me [Outro] Promise that you'll sing about me forever Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh Promise that you'll sing about me forever Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh Promise that you'll sing about me forever Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh Promise that you'll sing about me forever Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooh [Part II: "I'm Dying of Thirst"] [Skit] (On the phone) "Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?"

[Chorus: Kanye West] Tell me if you know someone that needs ( Jesus, Lord ) Now we've been through a lot of things Tell me if you know someone that needs ( Jesus, Lord ) He lives in a lot of things Tell me if you know someone that needs ( Jesus, Lord ) Been through a lot of things Tell me if you know someone that needs ( Jesus, Lord ) [Verse 1: Kanye West] Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin' About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin' Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons ( Jesus ) I watched so many people leave ( Lord ) I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sеasonin' God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in I know I madе a promise that I'd never let the reaper in ( Jesus ) But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends ( Lord ) And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs ( Jesus ) Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there ( Lord ) And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed ( Jesus ) Then they tell you that you good and just stay focused ( Lord ) Mama, you was the life of the party I swear you brought life to the party When you lost your life, it took the life out the party ( Jesus ) That woman rode with me like a Harley ( Lord ) Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army 'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney ( Jesus ) You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares ( Lord ) 'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear ( Jesus ) And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares ( Lord ) I deaded those night terrors when the night clears And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life? And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? ( Jesus ) But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy ( Lord ) You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic Little boy dies, he just wanted a Mystic And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim ( Jesus ) And she's getting high and she's getting addicted ( Lord ) And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it ( Jesus ) But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward ( Lord ) Baby shower time, father didn't show up Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up ( Jesus ) A year done went by, her daughter just turned one ( Lord ) And she's still dependent on her mom Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun He want revenge 'cause the pain feelin' numb ( Jesus ) And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved ( Lord ) Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up? From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us ( Jesus ) A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys ( Lord ) Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside ( Jesus ) He even let him get the last meal He done with the streets after this, this his last kill ( Lord ) He gotta show him that it's that real He ran up on him with the pipe like, "****, stand still" ( Jesus ) "You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" ( Lord ) "Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ" He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ" Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light ( Jesus, Lord ) [Chorus: Kanye West] Tell me if you know someone that needs ( Jesus, Lord ) [Verse 2: Jay Electronica] Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah) Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul ( Jesus ) Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage ( Lord ) To the monk who visit Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Sheesh) It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor Back from the great and yonder, the son of man and the son of Donda ( Jesus ) I never rode the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda ( Lord ) But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts) What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana ( Jesus ) In Tepoztlán, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco ( Lord ) I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan ( Jesus ) As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel ( Lord ) I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castillo ( Jesus ) I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears ( Lord ) My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier It's a war outside, it's a war outside ( Jesus ) It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside ( Lord ) [Chorus: Kanye West] Tell me if you know someone that needs ( Jesus, Lord ) Now we've been through a lot of things Tell me if you know someone that needs ( Jesus, Lord ) He lives in a lot of things Tell me if you know someone that needs ( Jesus, Lord ) Been through a lot of things Tell me if you know someone that needs ( Jesus, Lord ) [Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West ] What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office You might not have been the only one that could've did that But you were the one that did do that And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight You know, to me, it kinda feels like Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids Have all been incarcerated through this journey And we haven't even been to jail We have been looked at and treated as criminals For being a part of this family My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in Is that he wanted to make a change in this community ( Tell me if you know someone that needs ) 'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him And it's what made the children of today After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years Man, he would be dead to me I didn't sign up for that I didn't stay on this journey this long for that All my life, man I've been waitin' for my father to come home They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated He still not home Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin' Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather Even though it is not seen that way for some of us But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community Who deserves to breathe free air Free my father ( Jesus ), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. ( Lord )

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? Could I let you down easily? Is your heart where it need to be? Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar? Or question my character and degrade me on every blog? Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question: [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar] When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired? Even though y'all share the same blood, is it worth the time? Like, who got your best interest? Like, how much are you dependent? How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending? How tough is your skin when they turn you in? Do you show forgiveness? What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended? What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing? What kind of bridge did they burn? Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom You wanna be remembered that delivered the message That considered the blessing of everyone This your lesson for everyone, say: [Refrain: Kendrick Lamar] When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

What the ground represent? The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil (Right) That's how I see it, my word is bond I see—, and the ground is the symbol for the poor people (Right) The poor people is gonna open up this whole world And swallow up the rich people 'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat (Mhm) And they gonna be so appetizing (Mhm) You know what I'm sayin'? Wealthy (Right), appetizing The poor gonna be so poor (Hungry), and hungry Right You know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be like— You know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be— There might—, there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu—, they might eat the rich, you know what I'm sayin'? A'ight, so let me ask you this, then Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich, or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities? I see myself as a natural-born hustler A true hustler in every sense of the word I took nothin', I took the opportunities I worked at the m—, the most menial and degradin' job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it Uh, I went from havin' somebody managin' me to me hirin' the person that works my management company (Right) I changed everything, I realized my destiny in a matter of five years, you know what I'm sayin'? I made myself a millionaire (Right), I made—, I made millions for a lot of people Now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying? I made millions for the record companies (Mhm) I made millions for these movie companies (Mhm) Now I make millions for, for us (Mm) And through your different avenues of success How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? By my faith in God, by my faith in the game And by my faith in "all go—, all good things come to those that stay true" (Right) You know what I'm sayin'? And it was happenin' to me for a reason You know what I'm sayin'? I was noticin'—, shit I was punchin' the right buttons and it was happenin' So, it's no problem, you know I mean, it's a problem, but I'm not finna let them know (Hmm) I'm finna go straight through Would you consider yourself a—, a fighter at heart, or somebody that, huh, somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh, threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance And not only me, but it goes down my family tree You know what I'm sayin'? it's in my veins to fight back A'ight, well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like "We fightin' a war—, I'm fightin' a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down"? In this country, a Black man only have like Five years we can exhibit maximum strength And that's right now, while you a teenager, while you still strong While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back 'Cause once you turn thirty, it's like They take the heart and soul out of a man Out of a Black man in this country And you don't wanna fight no more And if you don't believe me, you can look around You don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers (Mhm) That's crazy, because me, being one of your offsprings of—, of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that there's nothin' but turmoil goin' on, so I want to ask you, what you think is the future for me and my generation today? I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed, for real I don't think America know that I think America think we was just playin' and it's gonna be some more playin', but it ain't gonna be no playin' It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831 (Mhm), up in this motherfucker You know what I'm sayin'? It's go—, it's gonna happen (Mm) That's crazy, man In my opinion, the only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations A lot of people don't understand how important it is, you know Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out, or where it comes from Trip me out sometimes Because it's spirits We ain't even really rappin', we just lettin' our dead homies tell stories for us (Damn) I wanted to read one last thing to you It's actually something a good friend had wrote, describing my world It says: "The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it In order to protect itself from this mad city While consumin' its environment, the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar But having a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits Already surrounded by this mad city, the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him He can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as going home, and bringin' back new concepts to this mad city The result? Wings begin to emerge, breakin' the cycle of feelin' stagnant Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered Endin' the internal struggle Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different They are one and the same" What's your perspective on that? 'Pac? 'Pac? 'Pac?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings ] ( What did the Asian say? ) "A peace of mind" That's what the Asian said—I need a divine Intervention was his religion and I was surprised Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God Asked him "What are you doing?," he said "Taking my time Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?" [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings ] ( What did the Indian say? ) "A piece of land" That's what the Indian said—I needed the man Telling me "Longevity is in the dirt Should buy some property first Should profit a better dollar with generational perks Equity at his best, really, you should invest These tangible things expire, don't you expect Income with so much outcome and yes Look at my heritage, we blessed" [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings ] ( Now, what the black man say? ) "A piece of pussy" That's what the black man said, I needed to push me To the limit, to satisfy my hunger We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach What you saying to me? He said, "Nigga, come back to reality for a week" Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings ] ( What the white man say? ) A piece of mine's That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99 If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine What if I compromise? He said "It don't even matter You make a million or more, you living better than average You losing your core following, gaining it all" He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars "Look at what you accomplishing" – what he said to the boy "I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet Your world tour, your masters, mortgage, I need a piece" [Chorus: Bilal] I holler, "What you do? What you say?" I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today I holler, "What you do? What you say?" I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today [Saxophone Interlude: Terrace Martin] [Outro] What the black man say? Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply

[Hook: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar ] Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow And that means the world to me And that means the world to me And that means the world to me And that means the world to me Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow And this I know [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk How come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me So I justify his name on obituary Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart? Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked Watch you when you walk inside your house You threw your briefcase all on the couch I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone [Hook: Anna Wise] Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow And that means the world to me And that means the world to me And that means the world to me And that means the world to me [Verse 2: Punch & Kendrick Lamar ] He drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle Lit off Henny, I'm tryna dismantle These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble 'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin' Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall Studied the son of God and still don't recognize my flaws I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful I pray my experience helps you As for me I'm tryna sort it out Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul But who knows? I just need a little space to breathe I know perception is key, so I am king [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock ] The other side has never mortified my mortal mind The borderline between insanity is Father Time I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind I know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice I'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe I'm losing faith Genocism and capitalism just made me hate Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake I'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates? Or this is just a mirage or a facade Wait

The shock value of my success put bolts in me All this money, is God playin' a joke on me? Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job? Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before? At twenty-seven, my biggest fear was losin' it all Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin' Thirty shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt? I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers? The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin' Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin' I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck At twenty-seven years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me What they see from me would trickle down generations in time What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride 'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap Damn [Bridge 2: Bēkon] God damn you, God damn me God damn us, God damn we God damn us all [Outro: Carl Duckworth] Verse 2 says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities" So until we come back to these commandments Until you come back to these commandments We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse Because He said He's gonna punish us The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians Are the true children of Israel We are the Israelites, according to the Bible The children of Israel He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience Because we chose to follow other gods That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised That's why we're in the position that we're in Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live Here, in today, in the United States of America I love you, family, and I pray for you God bless you Shalom

[Intro: Dash Snow, Daniel Joseph & Kendrick Lamar ] "I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in." "So what keeps you alive?" "Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing." Thank you [Verse: Kendrick Lamar] Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses You should either hear me now or go deaf Or end up dead, die trying and know death Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga I mean that from the bottom of my heart You see my art is all I have And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from We buy guns and more guns to give to the young I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight He told me "Rap about life, not rap niggas" That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin' My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching I start evaluatin' that my final intuition Is that you wishin' to come up or just come up We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance Put burners in the hands of the black man One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am You probably even listened to "Faith," and think I know Zion But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth Because it seem like it's always clashing with science I got a big fear of flying My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice I ain't lying I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness You just mind your business You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis It's kind of scary, ain't it? You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless? 'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him Facing 25 to life with a murder charge Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God I pray these bars get farther than Compton And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise I promise to keep it honest Secret society, all we ask is trust And all we lack is communication like service sucks The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come And I'm like, "The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?" Gotta keep it pushing Can't let the government tell me how my future looking I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins' If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin' Never will I surrender I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter How splendid, I guess my project had did it Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different They said seven tracks, I said 15 Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin' But little did they know, I’m tryna' change the rules That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions Uppity bitches handling business Killing our dreams, stealing our vision Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home In LA everybody think they fucking on Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone I swear to God most of y'all cats just don’t know Kendrick You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended Ain’t doing this for my health, I’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living Look, the mastermind took the master's mind Just the perfect time, just to master mine Just to match the grind with precision Look, the mastermind took - (cough) [Outro: Alori Joh] We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP .

[Intro: Deyra Barrera] Que reflejan tu mirada La noche, tú y yo [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] I got this fire burnin' in me from within Concentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin Every day, a new version of me, a third of me demented, cemented in pain Juggling the pros and cons of fame I don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul I recollect this isolation, I was four years old Truth be told, I've been battling myself Tryna navigate the real and fake Cynical about the judgement day I did past life regression last year and it fucked me up Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus Body after body, lesson after lesson, let's take it back to Michigan in 1947 My father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him I didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level The most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel And so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world With my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect While the record business loved me I was head of rhythm and blues The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose But I manipulated power as I lied to the masses Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] Another life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin' Circuit Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed A musical genius what the articles emphasized Had everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments I needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin' My first assistant was a small town scholar Never did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] My present life is Kendrick Lamar A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe The only factor I respected was raisin' the bar My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin' Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment I close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious I'm yelling, "Father, did I finally get it right?" Everything I did was selfless I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them I didn't gloat, even told 'em, "No," when the vultures came Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed Son, you do well, but your heart is closed I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself Father, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down "But your pride has to die," okay, Father, show me how Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for I kept one hundred institutions paid Okay, tell me more I put one hundred hoods on one stage Okay, tell me more I'm tryna push peace in L.A. But you love war No, I don't Oh, yes, you do Okay, then tell me the truth Every individual is only a version of you How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart? I could tell you where I'm going I could tell you who you are You fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent My greatest music director was you It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues It was harmony and motion I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken Rehabilitation, not psychosis But now we here now Centuries you manipulated man with music Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving You came a long way from garnishing evilish views And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel I'm using words for inspiration as an idea So can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted? I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow? I vow my life just to live one in harmony now You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity And I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy Then let's rejoice where we at I rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated

See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin' What I do through and through and I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters From botched robberies, niggas crouched over Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over Knocked down by some clown When child support knocked, "No, he's not around" Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways Just read a magazine that fucked up my day How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?

Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits? But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment? Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha) And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?

Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope Do not step to me I'm awkward, I box lefty An orphan, my pops left me And often my mama wasn't home Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown 'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings My demeanor thirty years my senior My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up Raisin' my fingers to critics , raisin' my head to the sky Big, I did it, multi before I die No lie, just know I chose my own fate I drove by the fork in the road and went straight [Verse 4: Eminem] See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape? Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' "Dixie" While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you What did I do? (Huh?), I'm just a kid from the gutter Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin' [Chorus: Eminem & JAY-Z ] Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to talk about anything ( Anything? ), anything ( Anything ) Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to holler about anything (Anything?), anything (Anything) Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to talk about anything ( Anything? ), anything ( Anything ) Renegade, never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day 'Cause I'm a renegade Never been afraid to holler about anything (Anything?), anything (Anything)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] I'm sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody One man standin' on two words, heal everybody Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five I still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision In the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife Starin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober [Chorus: Beth Gibbons] I wish I was somebody Anybody but myself Ooh, I wish I was somebody Anybody but myself [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] I remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas Family ties, they accused my cousin, "Did he touch you, Kendrick?" Never lied, but no one believed me when I said "He didn't" Frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself I started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy Water watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me Spirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me "Did he touch you?" I said "No" again, still they didn't believe me Mother's brother said he got revenge for my mother’s face Black and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase 'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over Blame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober [Chorus: Beth Gibbons] I wish I was somebody Anybody but myself Ooh, I wish I was somebody Anybody but myself [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] I was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind I need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined I did it sober sittin' with myself, I went through all emotions No dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer Intoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention Insecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women Whitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen Askin' God, "Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?" Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, "Is there an addiction?" I said "No," but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy I asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her "No" I never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection Though it never happened, she wouldn't agree Now I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced Amplified as I write this song , I shiver 'cause I'm nervous I was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years Nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood But Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could All those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked I pray our children don't inherit me and feelings I attract A conversation not bein' addressed in Black families The devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other Psychotic torture between our lives, we ain't recovered Still livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance Every other brother has been compromised I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused I see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos So listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school His anger grows deep in misogyny This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain I hope Hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation [Chorus: Beth Gibbons] I wish I was somebody Anybody but myself Ooh, I wish I was somebody Anybody but myself [Interlude: Whitney Alford] You did it, I'm proud of you You broke a generational curse Say "Thank you, dad" Thank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother Mr. Morale [Outro: Sam Dew] Before I go in fast asleep, love me for me I bare my soul and now we're free

Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck Shit, everybody stupid Yeah, well, you need to talk to somebody Reach out to Eckhart [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar] I come from a generation of home invasions and I got daddy issues, that's on me Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, "Fuck a foul" I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my lifе Daddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don't take those well Momma said, "That boy is exhausted," he said, "Go fuck yourself If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch You could be a bitch or step out the margin," I got up quick I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues [Chorus: Sampha] Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah) Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chase- (Ah) Early mornin' wake-ups (Wake-ups), practicin' on day-offs (Ah, day-offs) Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Sampha ] I got daddy issues, that's on me Lookin' for, "I love you", rarely empathizin' for my relief A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee 'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped His momma died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon? His first reply was, "Son, that's life, and bills got no silver spoon" Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'n'em This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific ( Ah ) Need assistance with the way I was brought up ( Ah, ah ) What's the difference when your heart is made of stone And your mind is made of gold And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul? My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin' Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves 'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was And to my partners that figured it out without a father I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes 'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues [Chorus: Sampha] Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah) Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser

Well, sort of, I think 'em That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of "Damn, is he really that caught up?" I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up? I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort Or even a four-track recorder So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche Spoil yourself, that's important If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many men Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan" Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because— [Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West ] Diamonds are forever (forever, forever) Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever) The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme Forever ever?

This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back "What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?" They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen" But r-r-r-right here stands a man With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands [Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West ] Diamonds are forever (forever, forever) Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever) The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme Forever ever?

It's the life Once again it's the life, yes I don't know why, I... get so high, oh It's intoxicating, man, y'all don't know why you do what you do Get so high, oh, get so high, high off the life [Verse 1: JAY-Z] The allure of breaking the law Was always too much for me to ever ignore I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses In love with a V-Dub engine Man, I'm high off life – fuck it, I'm wasted Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist My women-friends get tennis bracelets Trips to Venice, get their winters replaced with The sun – it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it I put my feet in the footprints left to me Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy Man, my brother hustled so, naturally Up next was me, but what perplexes me Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play The starring role in "Hovito's Way" [Chorus: JAY-Z, Pharrell ] It's just the life – I solemnly swear To change my approach, stop shaving coke Stay away from hoes, put down the toast 'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!) But every time I felt "That was that," It'd call me right back It'd called me right back Man, it'd call me right back (Oh no!) [Verse 2: JAY-Z] I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real Peel the top up like a toupée, mix the water with the soda Turn the pot up, make a soufflé All of y'all can get it like group-page on your two-way I'm living proof that crime do pay Say "hooray" to the bad guy, and all the broads Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game Putting 'caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train: All in the name of love Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came Over the house, to take back everything that they claimed Or even the worse pain is the distress, learning you're the mistress, Only after that love gets slain, and the anger and the sorrow mixed up Leads to mistrust – now it gets tough to ever love again But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain To all the Christies in every cities and Tiffany Lanes: We all hustlers in love with the same thing [Chorus: JAY-Z, Pharrell ] It's just the life – I solemnly swear To change my approach, stop shaving coke Stay away from hoes, put down the toast 'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!) But every time I felt "That was that," It'd call me right back It'd call me right back Man, it'd call me right back (Oh no!) [Verse 3: Jay-Z] I never felt more alive than riding shotgun In Klein's green 5', until the cops pulled guns And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need – What the game did to my pulse – with no results And you can treat your nose and still won't come close The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off By any means necessary, whatever the cost Even if it means lives is lost And I can't explain why I just love to get high Drink, lights, smoke, the blueberry sky Blink twice – I'm in the blueberry 5' You blink three times – I may not even be alive I mean, even James Dean couldn't escape the allure Dying young, leaving a good-looking corpse Of course... [Chorus: JAY-Z, Pharrell ] I solemnly swear To change my approach, stop shaving coke Stay away from hoes, put down the toast 'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)

[Produced by DJ Premier] [Hook: Snoop Dogg & Prodigy ] "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body" "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me" "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body" "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "I can't die, I can't die, I can't die" [Verse 1: Jay-Z] This shit is wicked on these mean streets None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win But then again, maybe it's for the best though 'Cause when they're seein' too much You know they're tryna get you touched Whoever said illegal was the easy way out Couldn't understand the mechanics And the workings of the underworld, granted Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti That's right, it's wicked – that's life, I live it Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends I break bread with the late heads Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils [Hook: Snoop Dogg & Prodigy ] "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body" "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me" "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body" "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "I can't die, I can't die, I can't die" [Verse 2: Jay-Z] We used to fight for building blocks Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin' The closest of friends when we first started But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense Who could ever foresee? We used to stay up all night at slumber parties Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep All the years we were real close Now I see his fears through her tears Know she's wishin' we were still close Don't cry, it is to be In time I'll take away your miseries and make it mine D'evils [Hook: Snoop Dogg & Prodigy ] "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body" "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me" "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body" "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "I can't die, I can't die, I can't die" [Verse 3: Jay-Z] My flesh no nigga could test, my soul is possessed By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses The Exorcist got me doin' sticks Like, "Homie, you don't know me But the whole world owe me, strip!" Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly But now this higher learning got the Remy in me Liquor's invaded my kidneys Got me ready to lick off – Momma, forgive me I can't be held accountable, D'evils beatin' me down, boo Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true Come test me, I never cower For the love of money, son, I'm givin' lead showers Stop screamin', you know the demon said it's best to die And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify D'evils [Outro: Snoop Dogg] "Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?" "I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"
