Leave 'em by the benches\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh lord please don't let me be misunderstood\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI see the future better than your computers\nApple software got the next 10 years scared\nI'm Fred Krueger\nRugers on my hip, terminate all intruders\nLeave them dead inside the sewers\nShoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer\nBurning up the very sun, the rapture\nThe god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster\nI'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield\nThe 9 milli' is handheld, the AK is hands-on\nNow the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb\nInside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect\nIf I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check\nPreach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if I'm lying\nKing of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel\nBecause I don't need to get sidetracked,\nmy producer name is Sounwave and he gives me beats by the batch\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh lord please don't let me be misunderstood\n\n[Verse 3: Jay Rock]\nMy flow cold, like Aspen\nI love to show off when I'm in that Aston\nLook I act a ass, but I'm not jack\nA east side nigga I can get you popped at\nA hundred rounds nigga stop that\nYou can't make that ass sit or flip-flop back\nI'm too gutta nigga top that\nThis is lyrical homicide, not rap\nSo don't get it misunderstood\nSay my name on your bars, shit I'm in your hood\nWith 45 goons 45 shugs\nChase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof\nI see you big dogs, all I hear is woof\nLoud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss\nI'm off that bubble kush, thinking about life\nOr how to make a mill and spend it all in one night\nI just might...\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\n...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite\nFor the top dog catalog, that means everybody\nSeveral bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers\nDamn I hate rappers, don't call me that\nIf you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap\nI don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real\nEat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will\nHold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill\nFour fifteens I got beat like Emmett Till\nPut me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head\nTell them about the g-code, like eskimos\nMy arms froze, popsicle\nObserving the game, I'm so official"

Dot had turned Curious George\nYou know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for\nLike what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads?\nBefore he turned right to get them shots through the door?\nThey say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic\nSo he'd risk his own life to get someone else killed?\nBut in the process, get injure? It don't make sense\nIt's like\n'The Da Vinci Code'\n, trying to solve the crime of these rap souls\nWhat if B.I.G. never did it big?\nNever went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bulletholes?\nWould it make my flow more persistent?\nWould it raise up the bar of competition? Who knows\nWho told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with Hov?\nWould the battle be less interesting if it wasn't personal?\nIf Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening\nPeople thinking it's a publicity stunt\nWhat if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow?\nHip-Hop would really be fucked\nSomething like Milli Vanilli\nNothing different, quite similar\nFilling up my mind capacity\nThinking about Martin Luther\nOn the balcony, what if the shooter–\nBetter yet, what if Malcolm on the side?\nKilled two birds with one stone, both would've died\nNow let's rewind\n\n[Chorus: D'Angelo]\nBefore we go, can you imagine?\nPicture years with your mom\nCan you imagine?\nHang her picture in the sky\nCan you imagine?\nCall emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life\n\n[Verse 2: Jay Rock]\nImagine if Tookie was a Blood?

I’m cool like that\nOh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is back\nSee, I’m the author of the authors,\nthe father of the Austin Power fajja\nWho can bust like a charter, why bother?\nI know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life\nBut still I carry on like luggage on a flight\nThe realness in my bones is the DNA to life\nI can give you insight only if you’re in sight\nI’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike!\nAnd I ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes!\nI’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a Huxtable\nYou couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heights\nCloud 9, where you can find\nMe in my dime like Roosevelt in his prime\nWait 'til I’m in my prime\nThe moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion\nTo whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm\nI say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs\nIt’s not all about punchlines, I don’t do that\nI’m a Jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move back\nKendrick Lamar on the radar for success\nAiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neck\nI can never digress, ‘less I get demoted to death\nEven then I’ll be the best still, like a petty theft\nI will: conquer my biggest dreams\nOnce you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings\nNipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred\nAnd all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head\nBut still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal\nHumped our momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereo\nBackflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park\nWatched Power Rangers after school; here we go\nI’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise\nFor no faulty ass A&R or CEO\nWe ain't what you think and you think we’re back\nBut we’ve been here for decades, and I vouch for that\nOpen your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChat\nGet your other eye cracked\nI don’t rap, I-Iraq and declare war\nI enjoy watching enemies' blood pour\nI came up lower middle class, not poor\nSo don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me\nI need y’all to feel me\nAnd if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free\nMy feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived\nBy the ultimate prize I'mma get when I see your suicide"

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\n[Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game.\nIf it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample\nI played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called\nThe Dynasty\n.\nAnd at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um,\nI was listening to Dre\nChronic 2001\nat that time.\nAnd really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on\nThe Dynasty\nalbum.\nI could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level.\nAnd that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]\nAnd he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take\n.\nAnd he said\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"So what you think of this?\"]\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him?\nI was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home.\nAnd man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been.\nOne of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n[Donda West: \"Come on, let's just go\"]\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n[Donda West: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]\n...I unpacked all my shit.\nYou know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself.\nI loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\"\nAnd Beans was still working on his album at that time\n,\nso I came up there to Baseline,\nit was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a\nGucci bucket hat\non. I remember it like, like it was yesterday.\nAnd Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And\nreally I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.'\nTwo days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?\nYo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\n[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man.\nI'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show,\nThe Streets is Watching\n, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know.\nSo, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\"\nAnd I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward.\nSo,\nBlueprint\n, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single.\nAnd I just took that proudly, built relationships with people.\nMy relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that.\nAnd at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's\n,\nand they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders.\nWhatever.\nSo I'll play them these post-\nBlueprint\nbeats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever.\nEverybody out there listen here: I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didn't sign me.\nYou know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me,\nmy nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels.\nJessica Rivera, man...\n\n[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal.\nThe nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\n[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay, man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\n[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room.\nSo I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him\nand he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\n[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know\n.\nSo uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n[Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"]\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\"\nI told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do.\nThen, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\"\nand told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\n[Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"]\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever.\nI went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?"
